# Installation

Valor is comprised of a back end service (which consists of a REST API and a Postgres DB with the PostGIS extension) and a python client for interacting with it.

## Setting up the back end service

### Using docker compose

The easiest way to get up and running with Valor is to use docker compose with the `docker-compose.yml` file in the repo root:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/striveworks/valor
cd valor
docker compose --env-file ./api/.env.testing up
```

This will set up the necessary environment variables, start both the API and database services, and run the database migration job. To rest that everything is running properly, the endpoint `localhost:8000/health` should return `{"status":"ok"}`

**Note: running Valor this way is not intended for production and scalable use, and is only recommended for development and testing purposes**.

### Deploying via Docker and a hosted database

For a more production grade deployment, we publish the images `ghcr.io/striveworks/valor/valor-service` for the REST API, and `ghcr.io/striveworks/valor/migrations`, which is used for setting up the database and migrations. These can be paired with any Postgres database with the PostGIS extension.

The following environment variables are required for running these
| Variable | Description | Images that need it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POSTGRES_HOST` | The host of the Postgres database | `valor-service`, `migrations` |
| `POSTGRES_PORT` | The port of the Postgres database | `valor-service`, `migrations` |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | The name of the Postgres database | `valor-service`, `migrations` |
| `POSTGRES_USERNAME` | The user of the Postgres database | `valor-service`, `migrations` |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | The password of the Postgres database | `valor-service`, `migrations` |
| `POSTGRES_SSLMODE` | Sets the Postgres instance SSL mode (typically needs to be "require") | `migrations` |
| `API_ROOT_PATH` | the root path of the API (if serving behind a proxy) | `valor-service` |

Additionally, the Valor REST API has optional single username/password/bearer token authentication. To enable this, the `valor-service` image requires the following environment variables:
| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `VALOR_USERNAME` | The username to use |
| `VALOR_PASSWORD` | The password to use |
| `VALOR_SECRET_KEY` | A random, secret string used for signing JWT tokens |

### Helm Chart

Alternatively, we provide pre-built charts for deplying Valor on Kubernetes via Helm using the following commands:

```shell
helm repo add valor https://striveworks.github.io/valor-charts/
helm install valor valor/valor
# Valor should now be avaiable at valor.namespace.svc.local
```

### Manual Deployment

If you would prefer to build your own image or want a debug console for the back end, please see the deployment instructions in [Contributing to Valor](contributing.md).

## Setting up the Python client

The python client can be installed via pip:

```shell
pip install valor-client
```
