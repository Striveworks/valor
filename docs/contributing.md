## Contribution Workflow

Generally, the high-level workflow for contributing to this repo includes:

1. Submitting an issue or enhancement request using the appropriate template on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Striveworks/velour/issues)
2. Gathering feedback from devs and the broader community in your issue _before_ starting to code
3. Forking the Velour repo, making your proposed changes, and submitting a pull request (PR). When submitting a pull request, please be sure to:
     1. Update the README.md and/or any relevant docstrings with details your change.
     2. Add tests where necessary.

# Development Tips & Tricks

## Deploying the Backend for Development

### Docker Compose

The fastest way to test the API and Python client is via Docker Compose. Start by setting the environment variable `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to your liking, then start Docker and build the container:

```shell
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD="my_password"
docker compose up
```

### Makefile (requires Docker)

Alternatively, you may want to run the API service from a terminal to enable faster debugging. To start the service, you can run:

```shell
pip install api # Install the API in your python environment

export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
export POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
make start-postgis # Start the postgis service in Docker
make start-server # Start the API service locally
```

## Setting-Up Your Environment

Creating a Velour-specific Python environment at the start of development can help you avoid dependency and versioning issues later on. To start, we'd recommend activating a new Python environment:

```bash
# venv
python3 -m venv .env-velour
source .env-velour/bin/activate

# conda
conda create --name velour python=3.11
conda activate velour
```

Next, install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure formatting consistency throughout your repo:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Finally, you're ready to install your client and API modules:

```bash
# Install the Client module
python -m pip install -e client/.[test]

# Install the API module
python -m pip install -e api/.[test]
```

## Use pgAdmin to Debug PostGIS

You can use the pgAdmin utility to debug your postgis tables as you code. Start by [installing pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/), then select `Object > Register > Server` to connect to your PostGIS container. The default connection details are listed below for convenience:

```
- *Host name/address*: 0.0.0.0
- *Port*: 5432
- *Maintenance database*: postgres
- *Username*: postgres
```

## Running Tests

All of our tests are run automatically via GitHub Actions on every push, so it's important to double-check that your code passes all local tests before committing your code. All of the tests below require `pytest`:

```shell
pip install pytest
```



### Running integration tests

```shell
pytest integration_tests
```

### Running bacend unit tests

```shell
pytest api/tests/unit-tests
```

### Running backkend functional tests

> **Note:** Functional tests require a running instance of PostgreSQL, which you can start using `make start-postgis-docker`.

```shell
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost \
pytest api/tests/functional-tests/
```
