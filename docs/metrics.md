## Classification Metrics
| Name | Description | Equation |
|:- | :- | :- |
| Precision | The number of true positives divided by the total number of positive predictions (i.e., the number of true positives plus the number of false positives). | $\dfrac{\|TP\|}{\|TP\|+\|FP\|}$ |
| Recall | The number of true positives divided by the total count of the class of interest (i.e., the number of true positives plus the number of true negatives). | $\dfrac{\|TP\|}{\|TP\|+\|FN\|}$ |

## Object Detection and Instance Segmentation Metrics**

| Name | Description | Equation |
| :- | :- | :- |

| Detailed Precision-Recall Curves | Similar to `PrecisionRecallCurve`, except this metric a) classifies false positives as `hallucinations` or `misclassifications`, b) classifies false negatives as `misclassifications` or `missed_detections`, and c) gives example datums and bounding boxes for each observation, up to a maximum of `pr_curve_max_examples`. | See [detailed precision-recall curve methods](#detailedprecisionrecallcurve)|


**When calculating IOUs for object detection metrics, Valor handles the necessary conversion between different types of geometric annotations. For example, if your model prediction is a polygon and your groundtruth is a raster, then the raster will be converted to a polygon prior to calculating the IOU.

| BLEU | A score between 0 and 1 indicating how much the predicted string matches the ground truth string (i.e., measuring precision), with a penalty for brevity. | See [appendix](#bleu) for details. |


# Appendix: Metric Calculations

## Binary ROC AUC

### Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)

An ROC curve plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) vs. the False Positive Rate (FPR) at different confidence thresholds.

In Valor, we use the confidence scores sorted in decreasing order as our thresholds. Using these thresholds, we can calculate our TPR and FPR as follows:

#### Determining the Rate of Correct Predictions

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| True Positive (TP) | Prediction confidence score >= threshold and is correct. |
| False Positive (FP) | Prediction confidence score >= threshold and is incorrect. |
| True Negative (TN) | Prediction confidence score < threshold and is correct. |
| False Negative (FN) | Prediction confidence score < threshold and is incorrect. |

- $\text{True Positive Rate (TPR)} = \dfrac{|TP|}{|TP| + |FN|} = \dfrac{|TP(threshold)|}{|TP(threshold)| + |FN(threshold)|}$

- $\text{False Positive Rate (FPR)} = \dfrac{|FP|}{|FP| + |TN|} = \dfrac{|FP(threshold)|}{|FP(threshold)| + |TN(threshold)|}$

We now use the confidence scores, sorted in decreasing order, as our thresholds in order to generate points on a curve.

$Point(score) = (FPR(score), \ TPR(score))$

### Area Under the ROC Curve (ROC AUC)

After calculating the ROC curve, we find the ROC AUC metric by approximating the integral using the trapezoidal rule formula.

$ROC AUC =  \sum_{i=1}^{|scores|} \frac{  \lVert Point(score_{i-1}) - Point(score_i) \rVert }{2}$

See [Classification: ROC Curve and AUC](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc) for more information.

## Average Precision (AP)

For object detection and instance segmentation tasks, average precision is calculated from the intersection-over-union (IOU) of geometric predictions and ground truths.

### Multiclass Precision and Recall

Tasks that predict geometries (such as object detection or instance segmentation) use the ratio intersection-over-union (IOU) to calculate precision and recall. IOU is the ratio of the intersecting area over the joint area spanned by the two geometries, and is defined in the following equation.

$Intersection \ over \ Union \ (IOU) = \dfrac{Area( prediction \cap groundtruth )}{Area( prediction \cup groundtruth )}$

Using different IOU thresholds, we can determine whether we count a pairing between a prediction and a ground truth pairing based on their overlap.

| Case | Description |
| :- | :- |
| True Positive (TP) | Prediction-GroundTruth pair exists with IOU >= threshold. |
| False Positive (FP) | Prediction-GroundTruth pair exists with IOU < threshold. |
| True Negative (TN) | Unused in multi-class evaluation.
| False Negative (FN) | No Prediction with a matching label exists for the GroundTruth. |

- $Precision = \dfrac{|TP|}{|TP| + |FP|} = \dfrac{\text{Number of True Predictions}}{|\text{Predictions}|}$

- $Recall = \dfrac{|TP|}{|TP| + |FN|} = \dfrac{\text{Number of True Predictions}}{|\text{Groundtruths}|}$

### Matching Ground Truths with Predictions

To properly evaluate a detection, we must first find the best pairings of predictions to ground truths. We start by iterating over our predictions, ordering them by highest scores first. We pair each prediction with the ground truth that has the highest calculated IOU. Both the prediction and ground truth are now considered paired and removed from the pool of choices.

```python
def rank_ious(
    groundtruths: list,
    predictions: list,
) -> list[float]:
    """Ranks ious by unique pairings."""

    retval = []
    groundtruths = set(groundtruths)
    for prediction in sorted(predictions, key=lambda x : -x.score):
        groundtruth = max(groundtruths, key=lambda x : calculate_iou(groundtruth, prediction))
        groundtruths.remove(groundtruth)
        retval.append(calculate_iou(groundtruth, prediction))
```

### Precision-Recall Curve

We can now compute the precision-recall curve using our previously ranked IOU's. We do this by iterating through the ranked IOU's and creating points cumulatively using recall and precision.

```python
def create_precision_recall_curve(
    number_of_groundtruths: int,
    ranked_ious: list[float],
    threshold: float
) -> list[tuple[float, float]]:
    """Creates the precision-recall curve from a list of IOU's and a threshold."""

    retval = []
    count_tp = 0
    for i in range(ranked_ious):
        if ranked_ious[i] >= threshold:
            count_tp += 1
        precision = count_tp / (i + 1)
        recall = count_tp / number_of_groundtruths
        retval.append((recall, precision))
```

### Calculating Average Precision

Average precision is defined as the area under the precision-recall curve.

We will use a 101-point interpolation of the curve to be consistent with the COCO evaluator. The intent behind interpolation is to reduce the fuzziness that results from ranking pairs.

$AP = \frac{1}{101} \sum\limits_{r\in\{ 0, 0.01, \ldots , 1 \}}\rho_{interp}(r)$

$\rho_{interp} = \underset{\tilde{r}:\tilde{r} \ge r}{max \ \rho (\tilde{r})}$

## Average Recall (AR)

To calculate Average Recall (AR), we:

1. Find the count of true positives above specified IOU and confidence thresholds for all images containing a ground truth of a particular class.
2. Divide that count of true positives by the total number of ground truths to get the recall value per class and IOU threshold. Append that recall value to a list.
3. Repeat steps 1 & 2 for multiple IOU thresholds (e.g., [.5, .75])
4. Take the average of our list of recalls to arrive at the AR value per class.

Note that this metric differs from COCO's calculation in two ways:

- COCO averages across classes while calculating AR, while we calculate AR separately for each class. Our AR calculations matches the original FAIR definition of AR, while our mAR calculations match what COCO calls AR.
- COCO calculates three different AR metrics (AR@1, AR@5, AR@100) by considering only the top 1/5/100 most confident predictions during the matching process. Valor, on the other hand, allows users to input a `recall_score_threshold` value that will prevent low-confidence predictions from being counted as true positives when calculating AR.

## Precision-Recall Curves
Precision-recall curves offer insight into which confidence threshold you should pick for your production pipeline. The `PrecisionRecallCurve` metric includes the true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives, precision, recall, and F1 score for each (label key, label value, confidence threshold) combination. When using the Valor Python client, the output will be formatted as follows:

```python

pr_evaluation = evaluate_detection(
    data=dataset,
)
print(pr_evaluation)

[...,
{
    "type": "PrecisionRecallCurve",
    "parameters": {
        "label_key": "class", # The key of the label.
        "pr_curve_iou_threshold": 0.5, # Note that this value will be None for classification tasks. For detection tasks, we use 0.5 as the default threshold, but allow users to pass an optional `pr_curve_iou_threshold` parameter in their evaluation call.
    },
    "value": {
        "cat": { # The value of the label.
            "0.05": { # The confidence score threshold, ranging from 0.05 to 0.95 in increments of 0.05.
                "fn": 0,
                "fp": 1,
                "tp": 3,
                "recall": 1,
                "precision": 0.75,
                "f1_score": .857,
            },
            ...
        },
    }
}]
```

It's important to note that these curves are computed slightly differently from our other aggregate metrics above:

### Classification Tasks

Valor calculates its aggregate precision, recall, and F1 metrics by matching the highest confidence prediction with each groundtruth. One issue with this approach is that we may throw away useful information in cases where prediction labels all have similarly strong confidence scores. For example: if our top two predictions for a given ground truth are `{“label”: cat, “score”:.91}` and `{“label”: dog, “score”:.90}`, then our aggregated precision and recall metrics would penalize the `dog` label even though its confidence score was nearly equal to the `cat` label.

We think the approach above makes sense when calculating aggregate precision and recall metrics, but, when calculating the `PrecisionRecallCurve` value for each label, we consider all ground truth-prediction matches in order to treat each label as its own, separate binary classification problem.

### Detection Tasks

The `PrecisionRecallCurve` values differ from the precision-recall curves used to calculate [Average Precision](#average-precision-ap) in two subtle ways:

- The `PrecisionRecallCurve` values visualize how precision and recall change as confidence thresholds vary from 0.05 to 0.95 in increments of 0.05. In contrast, the precision-recall curves used to calculate Average Precision are non-uniform; they vary over the actual confidence scores for each ground truth-prediction match.
- If your pipeline predicts a label on an image, but that label doesn't exist on any ground truths in that particular image, then the `PrecisionRecallCurve` values will consider that prediction to be a false positive, whereas the other detection metrics will ignore that particular prediction.

### DetailedPrecisionRecallCurve

Valor also includes a more detailed version of `PrecisionRecallCurve` which can be useful for debugging your model's false positives and false negatives. When calculating `DetailedPrecisionCurve`, Valor will classify false positives as either `hallucinations` or `misclassifications` and your false negatives as either `missed_detections` or `misclassifications` using the following logic:

#### Classification Tasks
  - A **false positive** occurs when there is a qualified prediction (with `score >= score_threshold`) with the same `Label.key` as the groundtruth on the datum, but the `Label.value` is incorrect.
    - **Example**: if there's a photo with one groundtruth label on it (e.g., `Label(key='animal', value='dog')`), and we predicted another label value (e.g., `Label(key='animal', value='cat')`) on that datum, we'd say it's a `misclassification` since the key was correct but the value was not.
  - Similarly, a **false negative** occurs when there is a prediction with the same `Label.key` as the groundtruth on the datum, but the `Label.value` is incorrect.
    - Stratifications of False Negatives:
        - `misclassification`: Occurs when a different label value passes the score threshold.
        - `no_predictions`: Occurs when no label passes the score threshold.

#### Object Detection Tasks
  - A **false positive** is a `misclassification` if the following conditions are met:
    1. There is a qualified prediction with the same `Label.key` as the groundtruth on the datum, but the `Label.value` is incorrect
    2. The qualified prediction and groundtruth have an IOU >= `pr_curve_iou_threshold`.
  - A **false positive** that does not meet the `misclassification` criteria is considered to be a part of the `hallucinations` set.
  - A **false negative** is determined to be a `misclassification` if the following criteria are met:
    1. There is a qualified prediction with the same `Label.key` as the groundtruth on the datum, but the `Label.value` is incorrect.
    2. The qualified prediction and groundtruth have an IOU >= `pr_curve_iou_threshold`.
  - For a **false negative** that does not meet this criteria, we consider it to have `no_predictions`.
  - **Example**: if there's a photo with one groundtruth label on it (e.g., `Label(key='animal', value='dog')`), and we predicted another bounding box directly over that same object (e.g., `Label(key='animal', value='cat')`), we'd say it's a `misclassification`.

The `DetailedPrecisionRecallOutput` also includes up to `n` examples of each type of error, where `n` is set using `pr_curve_max_examples`. An example output is as follows:


```python
# To retrieve more detailed examples for each `fn`, `fp`, and `tp`, look at the `DetailedPrecisionRecallCurve` metric
detailed_evaluation = evaluate_detection(
    data=dataset,
    pr_curve_max_examples=1 # The maximum number of examples to return for each obseration type (e.g., hallucinations, misclassifications, etc.)
    metrics_to_return=[..., 'DetailedPrecisionRecallCurve'] # DetailedPrecisionRecallCurve isn't returned by default; the user must ask for it explicitely
)
print(detailed_evaluation)

## Text Generation Metrics

## General Text Generation Metrics

### Coherence

Coherence is a measure, on a scale of 1 to 5, of the collective quality of all sentences for a piece of text, with 5 indicating the highest coherence. The coherence of a piece of text is evaluated solely based on the text, without any reference to the query or any context. Because of this, the coherence metric can be applied to any text generation task.

Valor's implementation of the coherence metric uses an instruction that was adapted from appendix A of DeepEval's paper G-EVAL: [NLG Evaluation using GPT-4 with Better Human Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16634). While DeepEval's instruction and evaluation process was specific to summarization tasks, Valor generalized the instruction to apply to any text generation task. Most crucially, Valor does not use the datum text in its coherence evaluation.

## Q&A Metrics

### Answer Relevance

Answer relevance is the number of statements in the answer that are relevant to the query, divided by the total number of statements in the answer. This metric is used to evaluate the relevance of the answer to the query. The answer relevance metric is particularly useful for evaluating question-answering tasks, but might apply to some other text generation tasks.

Our implementation closely follows [DeepEval's implementation](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/tree/main/deepeval/metrics/answer_relevancy). We use the same two step prompting strategy and the same instructions.

## Text Comparison Metrics

### ROUGE

ROUGE, or Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, is a set of metrics used for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation software in natural language processing. The metrics compare an automatically produced summary or translation against a reference or a set of references (human-produced) summary or translation. ROUGE metrics range between 0 and 1, with higher scores indicating higher similarity between the automatically produced summary and the reference.

In Valor, the ROUGE output value is a dictionary containing the following elements:

```python
{
    "rouge1": 0.18, # unigram-based similarity scoring
    "rouge2": 0.08, # bigram-based similarity scoring
    "rougeL": 0.18, # similarity scoring based on sentences (i.e., splitting on "." and ignoring "\n")
    "rougeLsum": 0.18, # similarity scoring based on splitting the text using "\n"
}
```

Behind the scenes, we use [Hugging Face's `evaluate` package](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/rouge) to calculate these scores. Users can pass `rouge_types` and `use_stemmer` to EvaluationParameters in order to gain access to additional functionality from this package.


### BLEU

BLEU (bilingual evaluation understudy) is an algorithm for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation software in natural language processing. BLEU's output is always a number between 0 and 1, where a score near 1 indicates that the hypothesis text is very similar to one or more of the reference texts.

Behind the scenes, we use [nltk.translate.bleu_score](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/translate/bleu_score.html) to calculate these scores. The default BLEU metric calculates a score for up to 4-grams using uniform weights (i.e., `weights=[.25, .25, .25, .25]`; also called BLEU-4). Users can pass their own `bleu_weights` to EvaluationParameters in order to change this default behavior and calculate other BLEU scores.
