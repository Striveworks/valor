Valor is a collection of evaluation methods that make it easy to measure, explore, and rank model performance. Valor empowers data scientists and engineers to evaluate the performance of their machine learning pipelines and use those evaluations to make better modeling decisions in the future.

Valor is maintained by Striveworks, a cutting-edge MLOps company based out of Austin, Texas. It's core developers are [Charles Zaloom](https://github.com/czaloom), [Nick Lind](https://github.com/ntlind), [Benjamin Nativi](https://github.com/bnativi), and [Eric Korman](https://github.com/ekorman).
