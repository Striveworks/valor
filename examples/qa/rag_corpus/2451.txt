The generic component of its modern scientific designation, Panthera pardus, is derived from Latin via Greek ÏÎ¬Î½Î¸Î·Ï pÃ¡nthÄr. A folk etymology held that it was a compound of ÏÎ±Î½ pan ("all") and Î¸Î·Ï ("beast"). However, it is believed instead to derive from an Indo-Iranian word meaning "whitish-yellow, pale"; in Sanskrit, this word's reflex was à¤ªà¤¾à¤£à¥à¤¡à¤° pÄá¹á¸ara, from which was derived à¤ªà¥à¤£à¥à¤¡à¤°à¥à¤ puá¹á¸Ã¡rÄ«ka ("tiger", among other things), then borrowed into Greek.
