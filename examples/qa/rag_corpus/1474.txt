The SI unit tesla (T) for measuring magnetic flux density or magnetic induction (commonly known as the magnetic field  B\, ) was named in Teslaâs honour at the ConfÃ©rence GÃ©nÃ©rale des Poids et Mesures, Paris in 1960. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) of which Tesla had been vice president also created an award in recognition of Tesla.
