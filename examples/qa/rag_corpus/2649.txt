About 60% of the world's polar bears live in Canada,  where conservation laws are a provincial jurisdiction. Hunting quotas and restrictions relating to Indian status are in effect, but vary by province. About 500 bears are killed per year by humans across Canada,    a rate believed by scientists to be unsustainable in some areas, notably Baffin Bay.  Canada has allowed recreational hunters accompanied by local guides and dog-sled teams since 1970,    but the practice was not common until the 1980s.  Conservation initiatives conflict with northern resident's income from fur trade and recreational hunting, which can bring in $20,000 to $35,000 Canadian dollars per bear, mostly from American hunters.    Inuit are skeptical of conservation concerns because of increases in bear sightings near settlement in recent years.
