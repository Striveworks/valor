Some of the most outstanding athletes from the past include Hannes Kolehmainen (1890â1966), Paavo Nurmi (1897â1973) and Ville Ritola (1896â1982) who won eighteen gold and seven silver Olympic medals. They are also considered to be the first of a generation of great Finnish middle and long-distance runners (and subsequently, other great Finnish sportsmen) often named the "Flying Finns". Another long-distance runner, Lasse VirÃ©n (born 1949), won a total of four gold medals during the 1972 and 1976 Summer Olympics.
