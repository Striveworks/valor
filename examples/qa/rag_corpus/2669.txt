In 1784  his Recherches thÃ©oriques et expÃ©rimentales sur la force de torsion et sur l'Ã©lasticitÃ© des fils de metal  Histoire de lâAcadÃ©mie Royale des Sciences, 229-269, 1784  (Theoretical research and experimentation on torsion and the elasticity of metal wire) appeared. This memoir contained a description of different forms of his torsion balance. He used the instrument with great success for the experimental investigation of the distribution of charge on surfaces, of the laws of electrical and magnetic force, and of the mathematical theory of which he may also be regarded as the founder.
