 I have been accused of changing some wording on the Warren Commission Report to favor the lone-assassin conclusion. That is absurd. Here is what the draft said: "A bullet had entered his back at a point slightly above the shoulder and to the right of the spine.â To any reasonable person, âabove the shoulder and to the rightâ sounds very high and way off the side â and thatâs what it sounded like to me. That would have given the totally wrong impression. Technically, from a medical perspective, the bullet entered just to the right at the base of the neck, so my recommendation to the other members was to change it to say, âA bullet had entered the back of his neck, slightly to the right of the spine.â After further investigation, we then unanimously agreed that it should read, âA bullet had entered the base of his neck slightly to the right of the spine.â As with any report, there were many clarifications and language changes suggested by several of us.
