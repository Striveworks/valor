- Premier MÃ©moire sur lâElectricitÃ© et le MagnÃ©tisme  Histoire de lâAcadÃ©mie Royale des Sciences, 569-577, 1785 . In this publication Coulomb describes âHow to construct and use an electric balance (torsion balance) based on the property of the metal wires of having a reaction torsion force proportional to the torsion angleâ.  Coulomb also experimentally determined the law that explains how âtwo bodies electrified of the same kind of Electricity exert on each otherâ.
