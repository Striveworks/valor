Egypt also hosts an unknown number of refugees and asylum seekers. According to the UNDP's 2004 Human Development Report, there were 89,000 refugees in the country,  UNDP, p. 75.  though this number may be an underestimate. There are some 70,000 Palestinian refugees,  and about 150,000 recently arrived Iraqi refugees,  Iraq: from a Flood to a Trickle: Egypt  but the number of the largest group, the Sudanese, is contested. See  The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants for a lower estimate. The  The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights states on its web site that in 2000 the World Council of Churches claimed that "between two and five million Sudanese have come to Egypt in recent years". Most Sudanese refugees come to Egypt in the hope of resettling in Europe or the US.  The once-vibrant Jewish community in Egypt has virtually disappeared, with only a small number remaining in the country, but many Egyptian Jews visit on religious occasions and for tourism. Several important Jewish archaeological and historical sites are found in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities.
