Liechtenstein football teams play in the Swiss football leagues. The Liechtenstein Cup allows access to one Liechtenstein team each year in the UEFA Cup; FC Vaduz, a team playing in the Swiss Challenge League (i.e. the second level of Swiss football) is the most successful team in the Cup, and scored their greatest success in the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1996  when they defeated the Latvian team FC Universitate Riga by 1â1 and 4â2, to go on to a lucrative fixture against Paris St Germain, which they lost 0â4 and 0â3.
