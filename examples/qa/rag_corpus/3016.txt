Roosevelt has been quoted by virtually all the major Republican and Democratic candidates for the 2008 US Presidential Election.      Political pundits have brought up Roosevelt's name in book after book. The degree of discussion ranges from a single sentence by democrat Bill Richardson talking about him as "BR" breaking Roosevelt's (or "TR") 1907 single handshaking record, John Edwards mentioning Roosevelt in a fall of 2007 speech to John McCain devoting an entire chapter to him in his main background book. Even the lone candidate that did not mention Roosevelt in an autobiographical book, democrat, Joe Biden, nevertheless, began mentioning Roosevelt's taking on of corporate interests speeches in New Hampshire in the summer of 2007.
