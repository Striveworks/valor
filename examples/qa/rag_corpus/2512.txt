Monroe returned to the Virginia House of Delegates and was elected to another term as governor of Virginia in 1811, but he resigned a few months into the term. He then served as Secretary of State from 1811 to 1814.  When he was appointed to Secretary of War in 1814, he stayed on as the Secretary of State ad interim.  At the war's end in 1815, he was again commissioned as the permanent Secretary of State, and left his position as Secretary of War.  Thus from October 1, 1814 to February 28, 1815, Monroe effectively held the two cabinet posts.  Monroe stayed on as Secretary of State until the end of the James Madison Presidency, and the following day Monroe began his term as the new President of the United States.
