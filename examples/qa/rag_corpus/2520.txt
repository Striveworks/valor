When his presidency expired on March 4, 1825, James Monroe lived at Monroe Hill on the grounds of the University of Virginia.  This university's modern campus was Monroe's family farm from 1788 to 1817, but he had sold it in the first year of his presidency to the new college.  He served on the college's Board of Visitors under Jefferson and then under the second rector and another former President James Madison, until his death.
