In 1871 Grover Cleveland was elected Sheriff of Erie County, New York. At age 44, he emerged into a political prominence that carried him to the White House in three years.   Running as a reformer, he was elected Mayor of Buffalo in 1881, with the slogan "Public Office is a Public Trust" as his trademark of office. One newspaper, in endorsing him, said it did so for three reasons: "1. He is honest.  2. He is honest.  3. He is honest."  In 1882, he was elected Governor of New York, working closely with reform-minded Republican state legislator Theodore Roosevelt.
