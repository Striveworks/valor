At the Republican Convention in Chicago, despite being the incumbent, Taft's victory was not immediately assured.  But after two weeks, Roosevelt, realizing he would not be able to win the nomination outright, asked his followers to leave the convention hall.  They moved to the Auditorium Theatre, and then Roosevelt, along with key allies such as Pinchot and Albert Beveridge created the Progressive Party, structuring it as a permanent organization that would field complete tickets at the presidential and state level. It was popularly known as the "Bull Moose Party," which got its name after Roosevelt told reporters, "I'm as fit as a bull moose." Carl M. Cannon, The Pursuit of Happiness in Times of War, Rowman & Littlefield: 2003, p. 142. ISBN 0742525929.  At the convention Roosevelt cried out, "We stand at Armageddon and we battle for the Lord." Roosevelt's platform echoed his 1907â08 proposals, calling for vigorous government intervention to protect the people from the selfish interests. Thayer, Chapter XXII, pp. 25 31.
