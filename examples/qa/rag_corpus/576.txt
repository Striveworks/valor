The attacks made against pre-Enlightenment "magical thinking," and the mystical elements of Christianity, were given their foundation with Boyleâs mechanical conception of the universe. Newton gave Boyleâs ideas their completion through mathematical proofs and, perhaps more importantly, was very successful in popularising them.    Newton refashioned the world governed by an interventionist God into a world crafted by a God that designs along rational and universal principles.    These principles were available for all people to discover, allowed people to pursue their own aims fruitfully in this life, not the next, and to perfect themselves with their own rational powers.
