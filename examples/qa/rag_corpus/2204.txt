The cause of his incapacitation was the physical strain of the demanding public speaking tour he undertook to obtain support of the American people for ratification of the Covenant of the League. After one of his final speeches to attempt to promote the League of Nations in Pueblo, Colorado, on September 25, 1919 , he collapsed.  On October 2, 1919, Wilson suffered a serious stroke that almost totally incapacitated him, leaving him paralyzed on his left side and blind in his left eye.  For at least a few months, he was confined to a wheelchair.  Afterwards he could walk only with the assistance of a cane.  The full extent of his disability was kept from the public until after his death on February 3, 1924.
