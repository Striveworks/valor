After Finland became independent there was a rise of modernist writers, most famously Mika Waltari. Frans Eemil SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1939   so far the only one for a Finnish author. The second World War prompted a return to more national interests in comparison to a more international line of thought, characterized by VÃ¤inÃ¶ Linna. Literature in modern Finland is in a healthy state, with detective stories enjoying a particular boom of popularity. Ilkka Remes, a Finnish author of thrillers, is very popular.
