The majority of Finns learn enough English in school and from media to be proficient in that language. Other common foreign languages studied are German and French. Education in the other national language is compulsory in junior high school for both Finnish and Swedish speakers. The exception is the autonomous Ãland Islands, where Finnish is not compulsory due to Swedish being the sole official language of the province.
