Romania has its unique culture, which is the product of its geography and of its distinct historical evolution. Like Romanians themselves, it is fundamentally defined as the meeting point of three regions: Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the Balkans, but cannot be truly included in any of them.  ROMANIA - CULTURE  The Romanian identity formed on a substratum of mixed Roman and quite possibly Dacian elements,    with many other influences. During late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, the major influences came from the Slavic peoples who migrated and settled in nearby Bulgaria, Serbia, Ukraine and eventually Russia;  from medieval Greeks and the Byzantine Empire;  from a long domination by the Ottoman Empire;  from the Hungarians;  and from the Germans living in Transylvania. Modern Romanian culture emerged and developed over roughly the last 250 years under a strong influence from Western culture, particularly French  and German culture.
