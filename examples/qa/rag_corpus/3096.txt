A high percentage of natural ecosystems (47% of the land area of the country) is covered with natural and semi-natural ecosystems.  Since almost half of all forests in Romania (13% of the country) have been managed for watershed conservation rather than production, Romania has one of the largest areas of undisturbed forest in Europe.  The integrity of Romanian forest ecosystems is indicated by the presence of the full range of European forest fauna, including 60% and 40% of all European brown bears and wolves, respectively.    There are also almost 400 unique species of mammals (of which Carpathian chamois are best known), birds, reptiles and amphibians in Romania.  |"EarthTrends:Biodiversity and Protected Areas - Romania"
