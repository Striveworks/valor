Around 35 wolves in 4 packs are now roaming the heaths of the eastern German region of Lusatia, a region along the German-Polish border, and they are now still expanding their range to the west and the north.    Wolves were first spotted in the area back in 1998, and are thought to have migrated from western Poland.    On December 15, 2007, a male wolf has been shot illegally in the district of LÃ¼chow-Dannenberg, Lower Saxony.  www.nabu.de
