The English name "Egypt" came via the Latin word   derived from the ancient Greek word AÃ­gyptos ( ). The adjective aigÃ½pti, aigÃ½ptios was borrowed into Coptic as gyptios, kyptios, and from there into Arabic as  , back formed into  , whence English Copt. The term is derived from Late Egyptian Hikuptah "Memphis", a corruption of the earlier Egyptian name Hat-ka-Ptah ( ), meaning "home of the ka (soul) of Ptah", the name of a temple to the god Ptah at Memphis.  Strabo provided a folk etymology according to which AÃ­gyptos ( ) had evolved as a compound from   ( ), meaning "below the Aegean".
