Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt (July 29, 1861 in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts â February 14 1884 in Manhattan, New York) was the first wife of Theodore Roosevelt and mother of their only child together, Alice Lee Roosevelt.  Alice Roosevelt died of an undiagnosed case of Bright's Disease two days after Alice Lee was born.  Theodore Roosevelt's mother Mittie died of Typhoid fever in the same house on the same day, Feb. 14, 1884.  After the simultaneous deaths of his mother and wife, Roosevelt left his daughter in the care of his sister in New York and moved out to Dakota Territory.
