Religion plays a central role in most Egyptians' lives. The rolling calls to prayer that are heard five times a day have the informal effect of regulating the pace of everything from business to entertainment. Cairo is famous for its numerous mosque minarets and church towers. This religious landscape has been marred by a record of religious extremism.    Most recently,  a December 16 2006 judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court of Egypt insisted on a clear demarcation between "recognized religions"âIslam, Christianity and Judaismâand all other religious beliefsâthus effectively delegitimatizing and forbidding practice of all but these aforementioned religions.     This judgment has led to the requirement for communities to either commit perjury or be subjected to denial of identification cards.
