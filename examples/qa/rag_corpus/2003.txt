Attending the University of Michigan as an undergraduate, Ford played center and linebacker for the schoolâs football team and helped the Wolverines to undefeated seasons and national titles in 1932 and 1933. The team suffered a steep decline in his 1934 senior year, however, winning only one game. Ford was the teamâs star nonetheless, and after a game during which Michigan held heavily favored Minnesota (the eventual national champion) to a scoreless tie in the first half, assistant coach Bennie Oosterbaan later said, âWhen I walked into the dressing room at half time, I had tears in my eyes I was so proud of them.  Ford and [Cedric] Sweet played their hearts out. They were everywhere on defense.â Ford himself later recalled, âDuring 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds.â  His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, âThey felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause.â
