With the exception of specimens in nature reserves, wolves in Belarus are largely unprotected. They are designated a game species, and bounties ranging between â¬60 and â¬70 are paid to hunters for each wolf killed. This is a considerable sum in a country where the average monthly wage is â¬230.  /ref>
