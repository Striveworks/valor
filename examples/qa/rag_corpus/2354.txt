National symbols are influenced by natural, historical, and First Nations sources. Particularly, the use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates back to the early 18th century and is depicted on its current and previous flags, the penny, and on the coat of arms.    Other prominent symbols include the beaver, Canada goose, common loon, the Crown, and the RCMP.
