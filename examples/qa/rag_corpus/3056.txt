In 2002, the oldest modern human (Homo sapiens sapiens) remains in Europe were discovered in the "Cave With Bones" (PeÅtera cu Oase) near Anina in present day Romania.    The remains (the lower jaw) are approximately 42,000 years old and have been nicknamed "John of Anina" (Ion din Anina). As Europeâs oldest remains of Homo sapiens, they may represent the first such people to have entered the continent.     The remains are especially interesting because they present a mixture of archaic, early modern human and Neanderthal morphological features.
