However, more recent genetic studies have shown that some clades of Brown Bear are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears, meaning that the polar bear is not a true species according to some species concepts. Marris, E. 2007. Nature 446, 250-253.  Linnaeus at 300: The species and the specious  In addition, polar bears can breed with brown bears to produce fertile grizzlyâpolar bear hybrids,  .   .  indicating that they have only recently diverged and are not yet truly distinct species.
