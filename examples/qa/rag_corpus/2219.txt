Wilson's words were repeatedly quoted in the film The Birth of a Nation, which has come under fire for racism. Thomas Dixon, author of the novel The Clansman upon which the film is based, was one of Wilson's graduate school classmates at Johns Hopkins in 1883-1884. Dixon arranged a special White House preview (this was the first time a film was shown in the White House) without telling Wilson what the film was about. There is debate about whether Wilson made the statement, "It is like writing history with lightning; my only regret is that it is all so terribly true.", or whether it was invented by a film publicist. "Family Life", Essays on Woodrow Wilson and His Administration, American President: An Online Reference Resource, Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia   Others argue Wilson felt he had been tricked by Dixon and in public statements claimed he did not like the film; Wilson blocked its showing during the war. Link vol 2 pp 252-54.  In a 1923 letter to Senator Morris Sheppard of Texas, Wilson noted of the reborn Klan, â...no more obnoxious or harmful organization has ever shown itself in our affairs.âAlthough Wilson had a volatile relationship with American Blacks he was a friend of the Ethiopian Emperor Halie Selassie, a black African Monarch. A sword(a gift from Selassie) can still be seen in Wilson's Washington DC home.   Link, Papers of Woodrow Wilson 68:298
