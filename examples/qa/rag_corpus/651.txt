Massachusetts sent Adams to the first and second Continental Congresses in 1774 and from 1775 to 1778.  In 1775 he was also appointed the chief judge of the Massachusetts Superior Court.  In June 1775, with a view of promoting the union of the colonies, he nominated George Washington of Virginia as commander-in-chief of the army then assembled around Boston. His influence in Congress was great, and almost from the beginning, he sought permanent separation from Britain. On October 5, 1775, Congress created the first of a series of committees to study naval matters.
