Volta is buried in the city of Como. At the Tempio Voltiano near Lake Como there is a museum devoted to explaining his work. Count Volta's original instruments and papers are on display there.  The building, along with his portrait, appeared on Italian 10.000 lira banknote, before the introduction of the euro.
