In recent years Qatar has placed great emphasis on education. Along with the countryâs free healthcare, citizens enjoy free education from kindergarten through to university. Qatar University was founded in 1973.  More recently, with the support of the Qatar Foundation,  some major American universities have opened branch campuses in Education City, Qatar. These include Carnegie Mellon University, Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, Texas A&M University, Virginia Commonwealth University, and Cornell University's Weill Medical College.  In addition, Northwestern University will offer undergraduate programs in communication and journalism starting in fall 2008. In 2004, Qatar established the Qatar Science & Technology Park at Education City to link those universities with industry. Education City is also home to a fully accredited International Baccalaureate school, Qatar Academy. Two Canadian institutions, College of the North Atlantic and the University of Calgary  also operate campuses in Doha.
