This sub-species (Lutrogale perspicillata maxwelli) of the smooth-coated otter was the subject of the book Ring of Bright Water by the British naturalist Gavin Maxwell, and is named after him.  It is native to the Tigris-Euphrates alluvial salt marsh of Iraq, but it has been suggested that it may have become extinct as a result of the large-scale drainage that has taken place in the region since the 1960s .
