Roosevelt's oldest daughter, Alice, was a controversial character during Roosevelt's stay in the White House. When friends asked if he could rein in his elder daughter, Roosevelt said, "I can be President of the United States, or I can control Alice. I cannot possibly do both."  In turn, Alice said of him that he always wanted to be "the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral."  (Some sources attribute this quote to one of Roosevelt's sons instead.)
