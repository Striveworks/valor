Singapore has a high literacy rate   . English is the first language learned by half the children by the time they reach preschool age and is the primary medium of instruction in primary school; however mother tongues are taught in the respective languages. English is the language of instruction for mathematics and the natural sciences. Special Assistance Plan schools may teach in another language to encourage more vibrant use of mother tongues.  Some schools also integrate language subjects with mathematics and the sciences, using both English and a second language.
