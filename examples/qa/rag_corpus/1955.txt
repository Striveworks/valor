Now came a long struggle to produce a full-scale engine.  This required more capital, some of which came from Black.  More substantial backing came from John Roebuck, the founder of the celebrated Carron Iron Works, near Falkirk, with whom he now formed a partnership.  But the principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder.  Iron workers of the day were more like blacksmiths than machinists, so the results left much to be desired.  Much capital was spent in pursuing the ground-breaking patent, which in those days required an act of parliament.  Strapped for resources, Watt was forced to take up employment as a surveyor for eight years.  Roebuck went bankrupt, and Matthew Boulton, who owned the Soho foundry works near Birmingham, acquired his patent rights.  Watt and Boulton formed a hugely successful partnership (Boulton & Watt), which lasted for the next twenty-five years.
