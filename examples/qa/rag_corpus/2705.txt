The name Singapura is derived from the Sanskrit words singa à®à®¿à®à¯à®     ("lion") and   à®ªà¯à®°   ("city").    According to the Malay Annals, this name was given by a 14th century Sumatran prince named Sang Nila Utama, who, landing on the island after a thunderstorm, spotted an auspicious beast on the shore that his chief minister identified as a lion.
