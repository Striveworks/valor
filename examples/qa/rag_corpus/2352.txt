Canada is a geographically vast and ethnically diverse country. There are cultural variations and distinctions from province to province and region to region. Canadian culture has also been greatly influenced by immigration from all over the world. Many Canadians value multiculturalism, and see Canadian culture as being inherently multicultural.  Multicultural heritage is enshrined in Section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
