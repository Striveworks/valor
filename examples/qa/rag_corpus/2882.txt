Historian Thomas Bailey, who disagreed with Roosevelt's policies, nevertheless concluded, "Roosevelt was a great personality, a great activist, a great preacher of the moralities, a great controversialist, a great showman. He dominated his era as he dominated conversations....the masses loved him; he proved to be a great popular idol and a great vote getter."    His image stands alongside Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln on Mount Rushmore.  Surveys of scholars have consistently ranked him from #3 to #7 on the list of greatest American presidents.
