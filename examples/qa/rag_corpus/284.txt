For some time, Thomas Lincoln was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky back country. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December of 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt.  The farm site is now preserved as part of Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.  The family belonged to a Baptist church that had seceded from a larger church over the issue of slavery. Though Lincoln was exposed to his parents' anti-slavery sentiment from a very young age, he never joined their church, or any other church for that matter.  As a youth he had little use for religion.
