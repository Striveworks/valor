    "# Example Notebook for Text Generation Metric Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates example use cases for the Valor text generation metrics. The Valor text generation metrics can be used across a variety of tasks which typically, but not always, involve prompting an LLM to generate some text. Use cases include Query Answering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (which can be thought of as a subcase of Q&A), Summarization and Content Generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the metrics can be applied across different use cases. For example, the BLEU metric can be used to compare predictions (generated text) to groundtruth answers in the case of Q&A/RAG, and can also be used to compare predictions (generated text) to groundtruth summaries in the case of Summarization. Conversely, some of the metrics are specific to a use case, such as the ContextRecall metric for RAG or the Summarization score for Summarization. \n",
    "\n",
    "In all three use cases below, we generate answers using GPT3.5-turbo and evaluate those answers with a variety of metrics. For the text comparison metrics, we compare GPT3.5-turbo's responses to groundtruth Huggingface answers/summaries for the RAG and Summarization datasets. For the llm guided metrics (which include the RAG metrics, Summarization metrics and general text generation metrics), we are using GPT4o to evaluate the responses of GPT3.5-turbo. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first example is RAG for Q&A. We download a RAG dataset from HuggingFace, use Llama-Index and GPT3.5-turbo to generate answers, and evaluate those answers with text comparison metrics, RAG metrics and general text generation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second example is Summarization. We download a CNN news dataset from HuggingFace which includes groundtruth summaries. We ask GPT3.5-turbo to summarize the articles. Then, we evaluate those summaries with text comparison metrics, summarization metrics and general text generation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third example is content generation. We manually create a few queries, each of a different query type (creative, educational, professional). Then we evaluate the generated content with general text generation metrics. "

    "In this example, the RAG pipeline produces answers to the given queries by retrieving context and then generating answers based on the context and query. Groundtruth answers are also known for these queries. Both the datums (which contain the queries) and the groundtruths are added to the dataset. Then, the predictions are added to the model, which includes the answer and the context used to generate that answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics requested include some text comparison metrics (BLEU and ROUGE), which do a text comparison between the generated answer and the groundtruth answer for the same datum. If the user only desires these metrics, then they do not need to include the context_list in the prediction and they do not need to supply the llm_api_parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, other metrics are requested that use llm guided evaluation (AnswerRelevance and Coherence). To get these metrics, the user needs to specify a client (openai or mistral), an api key and a model name, along with any other model kwargs. The api key can be stored in an environment variable or passed directly into model.evaluate_text_generation(). \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these metrics will use API calls to the specified LLM service to get information relevant for computing the desired metrics. Some of these metrics, such as AnswerRelevance and Coherence, do not require any context, so can be used with a Q&A model that does not use context. Currently, none of these metrics use the context in their API calls or computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that AnswerRelevance is specific to the Q&A setting (RAG is a subcase of Q&A). AnswerRelevance measures how relevant the answer is to the question, by measuring the proportion of statements in the answer that are relevant to the question. This would not work as well in a less structured setting, such as summarization or content generation, where some statements in the generated text may not be directly relevant to the query. "

      "Aston Villa take on Liverpool in their FA Cup semi-final encounter on Sunday with the competition both sides' last chance to win any silverware this season. Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp looks ahead to the Wembley showdown and where the match could be won and lost with individual player duels. CHRISTIAN BENTEKE v MARTIN SKRTEL . This will be a heavyweight contest that could decide the game. Christian Benteke is superb in the air and Martin Skrtel will have his hands full. Liverpool have to stop the supply line because defending crosses has been their Achilles heel this season. Christian Benteke (centre) scored the only goal of the game as Villa won 1-0 at Tottenham on April 11 . Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel (right) will have his hands full trying to stop Benteke on Sunday afternoon . FABIAN DELPH v JORDAN HENDERSON . This should be a good contest between two England team-mates. Fabian Delph’s new deal was a real boost for Villa - he drives that midfield, though he doesn’t get enough goals. You used to say the same about Jordan Henderson but he has improved so much. England international Fabian Delph (left) and Jordan Henderson are set for a midfield battle at Wembley . RAHEEM STERLING v RON VLAAR and NATHAN BAKER . Ron Vlaar and Nathan Baker make an imposing back line but they would rather be up against a Benteke than a Raheem Sterling, who will float around and make himself difficult to mark so he can use his lightning pace to get in behind them. Raheem Sterling's (left) pace and trickery is bound to cause the Villa defence a lot of problems . Ron Vlaar (left) was part of the Villa defence that kept a clean sheet at Spurs in the Premier League . The Holland international and Nathan Baker (right) will be hoping to do likewise against the Reds at Wembley .\n",

      "Juventus and Liverpool are continuing to monitor developments with Chelsea midfielder Oscar. The Brazil international has been criticised by Jose Mourinho in recent weeks and there are question marks over his future. Chelsea want to strengthen in the summer and may need a high profile departure to help balance the books. Juventus and Liverpool are interested in signing Chelsea 23-year-old midfielder Oscar . Oscar in action during Chelsea's 1-0 Premier League victory against Queens Park Rangers last weekend . Oscar cost Chelsea £19.35m and they would want a substantial profit on the 23 year-old. Paris Saintt Germain have shown interest in the past also. Juventus want a playmaker for next season and Brazil boss Carlos Dunga advised them to buy Oscar. 'He reminds me of Roberto Baggio,' he said. 'Oscar has technique, reads situations well and is a modern and versatile trequartista. He reminds me of Roberto Baggio, but also has similarities to Massimiliano Allegri. The former Sao Paulo youngster has struggled to make an impact for Chelsea this season . Brazil coach Dunga (pictured) revealed the Chelsea midfielder reminds him of Roberto Baggio . 'Brazilians like to have fun with their football, which hasn’t happened to Oscar very much recently, but I met Jose Mourinho and he spoke highly of all his Brazilian players. 'I tell Allegri that Oscar is strong and also a good lad. A forward line with him, Carlos Tevez and Alvaro Morata would drive any Coach crazy. 'It wouldn’t be a step backwards for Oscar to go to Juventus. He’d be decisive in Serie A and whether he plays for Juventus or Chelsea it’ll always be a great club.' Oscar celebrates scoring Chelsea's fourth goal during the 5-0 victory against Swansea in January .\n",
