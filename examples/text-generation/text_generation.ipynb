    "# Example Notebook for Text Generation Metric Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates examples use cases for the Valor text generation task type. The Valor text generation task type can be used across a variety of tasks which typically, but not always, involve prompting an LLM to generate some text. Use cases include Query Answering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (which can be thought of as a subcase of Q&A), Summarization and Content Generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all of the text generation metrics make sense for all of these use cases, however these use cases share many common metrics. For example, the SentenceBLEU metric can be used to compare to groundtruth answers in the case of Q&A/RAG, and can also be used to compare to groundtruth summaries in the case of Summarization. For another example, both the Coherence and Naturalness metrics can be used to evaluate the quality of generated text across all of these use cases. Some of these use cases also have use case specific metrics, such as ContextRecall for RAG or the Summarization score for Summarization. \n",
    "\n",
    "In all three use cases below, we generate answers using GPT3.5-turbo and evaluate those answers with a variety of metrics. For the text comparison metrics, we compare GPT3.5-turbo's responses to groundtruth answers/summaries for the RAG and Summarization datasets. For the llm guided metrics (which include the RAG metrics, Summarization metrics and general text generation metrics), we are using GPT4o to evaluate the responses of GPT3.5-turbo. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first example is RAG for Q&A. We get a RAG dataset from HuggingFace, use Llama-Index and GPT3.5-turbo to generate answers, and evaluate those answers with text comparison metrics, RAG metrics and general text generation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second example is Summarization. We download a CNN news dataset from HuggingFace which includes groundtruth summaries. We ask GPT3.5-turbo to summarize those articles. Then we evaluate those summaries with text comparison metrics, summarization metrics and general text generation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third example is content generation. We manually create a few queries, each of a different query type (creative, education, professional). Then we evaluate the generated content with general text generation metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "TODO potentially change this text depending on our implementations of Naturalness, Coherence, and other metrics. "

      "prediction: Roberto Martinez, Everton's manager, has not ruled out the possibility of offering new contracts to veteran defenders Antolin Alcaraz and Sylvain Distin. However, both players need to prove their value and importance to the team's future. Although Distin seems unlikely to be retained due to his age and recent lack of first-team appearances, Alcaraz may have a better chance of securing a short-term extension. Martinez emphasized the importance of all players showing improvement and commitment, including considering younger talents like Tyias Browning and Brendan Galloway for future roles. The club is also planning for the summer transfer window, with reports suggesting they are targeting players like Tom Cleverley, who Martinez has worked with before.\n"
