Write about a haunted house from the perspective of the ghost.,"As a ghost haunting the old, decrepit house on Elm Street, I am trapped in a state of perpetual torment and longing. I drift through the dusty halls, my translucent form flickering in and out of existence as I relive the memories of my past life.

My presence is felt by those who dare to enter the house, their hairs standing on end as they sense the chill in the air. I watch with a sense of sorrow as they scurry away in fear, my voice whispering in the darkness, trying to convey my desperation for release.

Memories of my life before death haunt me just as much as I haunt the living. I remember the warmth of the sun on my skin, the joy of laughter echoing through the rooms, and the love that once filled the walls of this house. But now, all that remains are shadows and echoes of what once was.

I long for peace, to move on from this place of eternal suffering. But I am bound to this house, my soul tethered to the physical realm by unresolved emotions and unfinished business.

So I continue to wander the halls, a ghostly figure condemned to haunt this house until the end of time, hoping that one day, someone will hear my whispers and help me find the peace I so desperately seek."
Explain to an elementary school student how to do long multiplication with the example 43 times 22. The resulting answer should be 946.,"Sure! To multiply 43 by 22, you need to follow these steps:

1. Write down the numbers vertically, with one on top of the other:

   ```
      43
   x 22
   -----
   ```

2. Start by multiplying the rightmost digit of the bottom number (2) by each digit in the top number. Write down each result below the line, leaving a space for the next step:

   ```
      43
   x 22
   -----
      86
   ```

3. Next, move to the left and multiply the left digit of the bottom number (2) by each digit in the top number. Write down each result with one position shifted to the left from the previous step. Add any results from previous steps that overlap:

   ```
      43
   x 22
   -----
     86
   +86
   -----
   ```

4. Finally, add the two results together to get the final answer:

   ```
      43
   x 22
   -----
      946
   ```

So, 43 times 22 equals 946. Great job!"
