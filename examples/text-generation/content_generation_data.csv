Write about a haunted house from the perspective of the ghost.,"As a ghost haunting the old, decrepit house on Elm Street, I am trapped in a state of perpetual torment and longing. I drift through the dusty halls, my translucent figure flickering in and out of existence as I relive the memories of my past life.

My presence is felt by those who dare to enter the house, their hairs standing on end as they sense the chill in the air and the whispers that echo through the rooms. I watch as fear grips their hearts, knowing that I am the reason for their unease.

I am bound to this house by unfinished business, a deep-rooted need for closure that eludes me even in death. I long to reach out to the living, to make them understand the pain and sorrow that consume me, but my ethereal form cannot touch them.

Yet, despite the fear and dread that my presence evokes, there is a part of me that yearns for connection, for someone to see beyond the horror and recognize the lost soul that I am. But until that day comes, I remain a ghost trapped within the walls of the haunted house on Elm Street, my existence a haunting reminder of the past that refuses to fade away."
Explain to an elementary school student how to do long multiplication with the example 43 times 22. The resulting answer should be 946.,"Sure! To multiply 43 by 22, you need to follow these steps:

1. Write down the numbers vertically, with one on top of the other:

   ```
      43
   x 22
   -----
   ```

2. Start by multiplying the rightmost digit of the bottom number (2) by each digit in the top number. Write down each result below the line, leaving a space for the next step:

   ```
      43
   x 22
   -----
      86
   ```

3. Next, move to the left and multiply the left digit of the bottom number (2) by each digit in the top number. Write down each result with one position shifted to the left from the previous step. Add any results from previous steps that overlap:

   ```
      43
   x 22
   -----
     86
   +86
   -----
    946
   ```

So, 43 times 22 is equal to 946."
