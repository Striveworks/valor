"(CNN) I see signs of a revolution everywhere. I see it in the op-ed pages of the newspapers, and on the state ballots in nearly half the country. I see it in politicians who once preferred to play it safe with this explosive issue but are now willing to stake their political futures on it. I see the revolution in the eyes of sterling scientists, previously reluctant to dip a toe into this heavily stigmatized world, who are diving in head first. I see it in the new surgeon general who cites data showing just how helpful it can be. I see a revolution in the attitudes of everyday Americans. For the first time a majority, 53%, favor its legalization, with 77% supporting it for medical purposes. Support for legalization has risen 11 points in the past few years alone. In 1969, the first time Pew asked the question about legalization, only 12% of the nation was in favor. I see a revolution that is burning white hot among young people, but also shows up among the parents and grandparents in my kids' school. A police officer I met in Michigan is part of the revolution, as are the editors of the medical journal, Neurosurgery. I see it in the faces of good parents, uprooting their lives to get medicine for their children -- and in the children themselves, such as Charlotte, who went from having 300 seizures a week to just one or two a month. We know it won't consistently have such dramatic results (or any impact at all) in others, but what medicine does? I see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places. Girl's seizures spur medical marijuana legislation in Georgia . Among my colleagues, my patients and my friends. I have even seen the revolution in my own family. A few years ago, when I told my mother I was investigating the topic for a documentary, I was met with a long pause. ""Marijuana...?"" She whispered in a half questioning, half disapproving tone. She could barely even say the word and her response filled me with self-doubt. Even as a grown man, mom can still make my cheeks turn red and shatter my confidence with a single word. But just last week she suddenly stopped mid-conversation and said, ""I am proud of you on the whole marijuana thing."" I waited for the other shoe to drop, but it didn't. Instead, she added, ""You probably helped a lot of people who were suffering."" I don't think we had ever had a conversation like that one. At that moment, I saw a revolution that can bring you to tears. The word revolution, comes from the Latin revolutio, to ""turn around."" I had my own turn around a couple of years ago, and at the time it was a lonely place to hold a supportive position on medical marijuana. Hardly any government officials would agree to sit down and be interviewed on the topic. Even patients I spoke to were reluctant to share their stories. It can be tricky, I learned, to be on the right side of science but on the wrong side of ideology. When we put the first ""Weed"" documentary on television in August 2013, I didn't know if anyone would watch our yearlong investigation. Even worse, I didn't even know if they would care. Is weed legal in your state? Just two years later, in ""Weed 3,"" we are eyewitnesses to a revolution in full swing. You will ride along with us for the dawn of the first federally approved clinical study on the use of marijuana for PTSD. You will meet patients such as Sean Kiernan, an accomplished investment banker, and Amelia Taylor, a stay-at-home mom. They are the remarkable and surprising faces of this revolution -- smart, successful and suffering -- unwilling to accept the fact that commonly prescribed medications often used to treat PTSD can be worse than the underlying disorder itself. Sean Kiernan nearly died, trying to get better. You will see what weed really does to your brain, in crystal clear images. This time around, you will hear from the heads of government agencies earnestly sharing their point of view, both Democratic and Republican senators, and even the President of the United States. This is what a revolution looks like. Your medical marijuana questions answered . When ""Weed 2: Cannabis Madness"" aired in March 2014, Boston researcher Rick Doblin believed the right people were watching. Just four days later, Doblin received a letter in the mail he had been waiting on for seven years that finally provided federal approval for his marijuana study. The federal farm where Doblin would have to obtain his marijuana is on the campus of Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi. In anticipation of a scientific revolution, the production of research-grade marijuana there has increased 30-fold in just the past year. Make no mistake, we have plenty of evidence that the approval and support of the federal government can fast track a revolution at a faster pace than we have yet seen. It was the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that spearheaded the research into a cure for AIDS, as well as stopping the spread of West Nile Virus. They were also responsible for the awesome task of eradicating polio and smallpox. Other successful federally backed programs include the human genome project, the BRAIN initiative and the Precision Medicine Initiative. There are no shortage of examples where the federal government has been a guardian of our public health needs, and you could argue that medical marijuana would also qualify as a worthwhile investment. 10 diseases where medical marijuana could have impact . There is now promising research into the use of marijuana that could impact tens of thousands of children and adults, including treatment for cancer, epilepsy and Alzheimer's, to name a few. With regard to pain alone, marijuana could greatly reduce the demand for narcotics and simultaneously decrease the number of accidental painkiller overdoses, which are the greatest cause of preventable death in this country. As I sat across from Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) and Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), I knew something extraordinary was happening. They were reciting the story of Charlotte Figi and countless other children. They were quoting back the data we had shared from our earlier investigations. They were extolling the potential virtues of the plant, and all of that was before the interview even started. There was an impatience about them, and they seemed in a hurry to make a large dent in marijuana reform. They want marijuana to be rescheduled. They want it now. They want doctors to be able to prescribe it at VA hospitals all over the country. They want it now. They want research dollars freed up to study the plant. They want it now. They want their fellow lawmakers at the state and national level to acknowledge what most of the world, including the citizens of the United States, have known for a long time: Marijuana is a medicine, that should be studied and treated like any other medicine. And they want all of it now. I spent much of our interview challenging them. I needed to remind them that people, long before me or them, have been trying to do many of these same things for 40 years, and had been rejected every time. I reminded them that politicians have a hard time winning elections on the issue of marijuana but less difficulty losing them. I challenged them every step of the way. ""This time will be different,"" Booker confidently told me as he walked out of the room. Is marijuana as safe as -- or safer than -- alcohol? I know how easy it is do nothing because I did nothing for too long. Take a good look at the data, educate yourself and talk to the patients, who are often out of options and find their hope in the form of a simple plant. Journalists shouldn't take a position. It makes sense. Objectivity is king. But, at some point, open questions do get answered. At some point, contentious issues do get resolved. At some point, common sense prevails. So, here it is: We should legalize medical marijuana. We should do it nationally. And, we should do it now. 9 things to know about legal pot .","CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta says we should legalize medical marijuana now .

"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie wasn't looking too presidential Tuesday night when he got into a heated debate with a veteran teacher at a town hall meeting. And now the state's largest teacher's union is calling him out for his 'bullying' behavior. 'He's always taken a very nasty and disrespectful tone with teachers and other individuals who dare to question him at these events,' Steve Wollmer of the NJ Education Association told NJ.com. 'It's the one thing that never seems to change.' Scroll Down for Video . Not being nice: New Jersey Gov Chris Christie (left) is being called a bully for the way he interacted with a teacher (Kathy Mooney, right) at a Tuesday night town hall meeting . That sentiment doesn't ring well with Christie's ambitions to run in the Republican presidential primaries next year. Tuesday night, Christie appeared at Kenilworth Town Hall to take questions from a group of citizens, when Kathy Mooney, a high school English Teacher from Roselle Park, took the microphone. Ms Mooney, who has been a teacher for 27 years, questioned Christie's motivations behind a legal settlement with oil company ExxonMobil which could have contributed drastically to the state's pension plans for teachers. Christie settled the deal for $225million, despite the fact that the state had originally asked for $8.9billion which Mooney described as 'favoring the affluent' and 'kicking state workers under the bus'. 'I know that you could have gotten more money, on the dollar,' Mooney said. 'Do you?' a defensive Christie quickly responded. 'You do know that? Really? You know that?' Mooney started to respond, but not before being cut off by the governor. A good deal? Mooney questioned Christie's decision-making behind a $225million legal settlement. The state originally wanted $8.9billion from the oil company, and Mooney says that would have had a huge impact on pensions for public employees . 'I mean: Do you know that?' Christie continued. 'I wanna know how you know that. Because you're a teacher, and you're standing in front of students every day, conveying to them, facts - things that they need to learn. So I would like to understand your analysis of how you know that in a ten year long, court case, that you have enough detail to know.' Mooney explains that she read about the deal in the newspaper and did not attend the meeting 'to be bullied'. 'You're not being bullied, because you're asking me a question, I'm going to ask you questions back,' Christie says, as he continues to dodge the issue. 'He said, ""I'm not bullying you' as he bullied her,""' Wollmer said of the exchange. Perhaps the reason why Wollmer and his union responded sharply to Christie's town hall meeting Tuesday night, is that he blamed the union for their role in the current pension system. 'The fact is your union, over the course of time, has asked for significantly higher benefits - more expensive benefits - that your union knew the state could not afford,' Christie said Tuesday.","The presidential hopeful held a town hall meeting in Kenilworth on Tuesday .
During the meeting, high school English teacher Kathy Mooney got up to ask the governor a question about pensions .

"YouTube star Cassey Ho has hit back at critics with a powerful and provocative new video, highlighting the cruel comments left by viewers of her fitness-focused clips who accuse the trim and toned online icon of being everything from ‘too fat’ to ‘ugly’ to ‘pudgy’. Cassey's YouTube channel, Blogilates, has over two million subscribers, so fans may have been surprised to learn that the negative comments left under the California resident’s fitness videos still manage to get under her skin – and have a much greater impact on her than any of the positive messages sent to her by her fans. But though mean and critical messages may have put a dent in the 28-year-old’s self-esteem, the workout pro is getting the last word with her latest video, The 'Perfect' Body, which examines just whether conforming to society's standards is the key to happiness, while highlighting some of the cruel comments she has received from viewers of her YouTube videos. Scroll down for video. Fighting back: In her new video, Pilates instructor and YouTube star Cassey Ho combats body-shamers who comment on her videos . She's only human: Seemingly full of confidence, Cassey said even she has felt bad about herself after reading nasty comments calling her 'fat' online . In a post on her Blogilates blog, Cassey said negative comments on her videos are nothing new, but the flood of nastiness has grown especially bad lately. She added that the trash-talking has even brought her to tears on more than one occasion. 'It’s hard to be content with the shape of your body when people are constantly telling you how fat you are, how much weight you need to lose, how much weight you need to gain,' she wrote. 'What do people want?' Cassey goes on to explain that, through her new video, fans can see what it's like to face that kind of negativity, and watch as her own self-esteem gets 'stripped away', leaving her feeling insecure and ashamed about her appearance. Fit or fat: The slim and toned blogger says that the negativity in the comments section of her YouTube channel has become especially nasty lately, and has even made her cry . Peanut gallery problems: In the new video, Cassey picks at her body, honing in on places that commenters say she could improve upon . The video begins with Cassey posting a selfie in gym clothes, taken just after a workout. She immediately starts to read the comments, and though they start off positive, soon people are telling her she shouldn't give fitness advice because she is fat. Cassey goes on to strip down to her underwear, examining, pinching and prodding her body, using the spiteful comments to direct her to different parts of her physique that people insist need changing. And as the video goes on, she grows more unsatisfied with herself as negative comments pop up around her. So the YouTube star gets to work, manipulating her body in a simulation of real-life Photoshop. She thins her thighs, hips, and waist, makes her butt and chest bigger, and even changes the color of her eyes. Finally, she posts another selfie of her 'improved' look - achieved with the help of a body double - but she is clearly still unhappy, and she uses this feeling to try and show viewers that giving in to body-shaming will only leave you worse off. Before and after: The fitness expert's body goes under a major transformation; Cassey used a body double to achieve the final look . Moral message: Even after making her butt and chest bigger and her waist and legs smaller, Cassey still doesn't find happiness at the end of the video . No Photoshop here: The retouching in Cassey's video was meant to prove a point - she doesn't use Photoshop in the photos she posts online . It seems that her 'take that' attitude has left her detractors speechless. Readers of her blog flooded the comments section of the latest post with overwhelmingly positive feedback. 'Thank you for standing up to this struggle for girls and women everywhere,' wrote one fan. Another chimed in: 'I absolutely applaud that you are your natural, beautiful self. I think you’re a wonderful inspiration for young people.' Cassey hopes viewers who relate to the video's message will share it in an effort to battle body shaming and cyber bullying.","Cassey Ho boasts over two million subscribers on her YouTube channel Blogilates .

"British taekwondo fighter Aaron Cook has confirmed he plans to compete for Moldova at the 2016 Olympics in Rio. Dorset-born Cook, 24, who was overlooked for the Great Britain taekwondo squad at London 2012, applied for citizenship after receiving funding from Moldovan billionaire Igor Iuzefovici and has now received his passport from the small eastern European state. 'I will soon begin a new journey representing the Republic of Moldova at all International competitions and hopefully the Rio Olympic games and beyond, should I qualify,' Cook wrote on his Facebook page. Three time European champion Aaron Cook (right) has refused to fight for Great Britain  since May 2012 .

'Although I am upset and disappointed I will not represent my country of birth at another major championships, I felt I had no other option. 'I am a fighter at heart and I am not going to throw away 20 years of dedication because of bureaucracy.' Cook, who fought for Team GB at Beijing 2008, felt he was overlooked for London 2012 - when Lutalo Muhammad, who was selected instead, won bronze - because he decided to quit the British programme in 2011. Cook is aggrieved at being overlooked in favour of Lutalo Muhammad, who won bronze at London 2012 . GB Taekwondo has always denied this, but Cook has refused to compete under the British flag since May 2012 and has fought for the Isle of Man since early 2013. 'It has been an amazing couple of years full of memories, and I would have loved to continue competing under the Isle of Man banner,' Cook said. 'Unfortunately that was never going to be possible as it was made clear to me in May of last year, after winning the European Championships for the third consecutive time, that it would not be possible for me to be selected for Team GB, regardless of my world ranking or performances. Cook competes against Mauro Sarmiento at the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008 . 'Having received no funding or support from the GB system and financing myself since June 2011, this was not a situation that was acceptable to me and I did not want to put myself, family, friends, supporters or sport through the same situation we were forced to endure at the London 2012 Olympic Games.' Cook hopes to represent Moldova for the first time at the inaugural Baku European Games in June having served the mandatory three-year period since representing a previous country. However, the British Olympic Association could yet block the move and Sportsmail understands it is still in talks over the matter.","Aaron Cook was overlooked by Team GB for the London Olympics .

"Arsene Wenger admits he is concerned Theo Walcott’s confidence is plummeting after his struggles with England this week. The Arsenal manager will have a heart-to-heart chat with the forward ahead of Saturday’s crunch top-four clash against Liverpool. Walcott was hauled off after 55 minutes of England’s 1-1 draw in Italy on Tuesday night. Theo Walcott struggled for England and Arsene Wenger admits he is concerned by the winger's confidence . Walcott was replaced by Ross Barkley after just 55 minutes of England's 1-1 draw against Italy on Tuesday . 2 - Premier League goals for Walcott this season - his average haul per season during his time at Arsenal is 5.6. It was the latest disappointment in a difficult season for the 26-year-old, who has struggled for game time since returning from a long-term lay-off due to a serious knee injury. With Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain out of Liverpool’s visit due to a hamstring strain, and Danny Welbeck a major doubt after sustaining a knee problem on international duty, Walcott could start on Saturday. But Wenger said: ‘Yes, I’m worried about Theo’s confidence. He’s sensitive and I’m a bit concerned about the damage that game can have on his mind. Walcott could face Liverpool on Saturday with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain injured and Danny Welbeck a doubt . ‘He’s not completely there yet (after the injury). But being exposed like that, people have a harsh judgement on him that is not deserved because he does well. ‘At the moment he is frustrated, but that is normal. I will speak with him, but I think he is strong enough. ‘I will see what state of mind he is in. We always have a word, if it is a positive experience or a negative experience, you ask “how did it go?”. We always speak about the last game. ‘He is not fragile mentally, he is strong mentally but he is disappointed because when you come back from an injury you always think you are ready. ‘He needs patience. He is at the moment not in his best mood. ‘He has big confidence in himself and he has gone through some difficult periods in his life and he has always come out with strength.’ Arsenal boss Wenger says he will speak with Walcott but believes the Gunners winger is 'strong enough' Walcott found himself playing in the No 10 role for England in Turin — a role he is not accustomed to. And Wenger admitted he was surprised to see the pacy forward in such an unfamiliar position. ‘Have I ever seen him play No 10 in training or anything? No,’ said Wenger. ‘Theo’s strength is the quality of his movements, he wants to go to get on the end of things. He’s not a guy who provides. ‘I don’t think it was the intention of Roy Hodgson to play him there. It’s maybe because Wayne Rooney took the initiative during the game to play higher up and tell Theo to drop back. ‘I didn’t see Roy Hodgson in the game stand up to say “Walcott, you come and play in midfield and Rooney you go up front”. That’s an initiative they took on the pitch.’ Walcott aims a shot at goal during England's friendly against Italy at the Juventus Stadium in Turin . Walcott was starting his first international game in 18 months having injured his cruciate ligaments . Meanwhile, Wenger insists there are fundamental flaws in FA chairman Greg Dyke’s proposal to increase the number of required homegrown players in Premier League squads to 12. Dyke believes increasing the number of British players in squads will help contribute to a more successful England team. But Wenger said: ‘I believe we are in a top level competition and you earn your right through the quality of your performance rather than your place of birth. ‘Secondly, I’m happy to, and would like to contribute to the quality of the English national team, but you have two questions you can raise before that. ‘First of all between 1966 and 1996 there were no foreign players in England and it didn’t improve too much the performances of the national team. ‘Secondly, if between the ages of 16 and 21 the England youth teams win every single competition in Europe then there is something we have to do because they are not getting their chance at the top level. Wenger believes there are flaws in FA Chairman Greg Dyke’s proposal to increase the homegrown quota . ‘That is not the case, on the contrary. I think between 16 and 21 the English youth teams, until now, have not performed. So that’s the heart of the problem. ‘Let’s get better at that level, then if there is a problem integrating these players in the top teams, we have to do something about it. ‘I think today you have to be very brave to integrate young players in the top teams because the pressure is very high. I still believe when they are good enough, they play. ‘You speak about Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane. Nobody stops the quality, no matter where they are from. So let’s focus on that first.’","Arsene Wenger will have chat with Theo Walcott ahead of Arsenal clash .

"An Australian doctor is the face of the latest Islamic State propaganda video in which the terrorist organisation announces the launch of its own health service in Syria. The propaganda video shows a man with an Australian accent who calls himself 'Abu Yusuf' and calls on foreign doctors to travel to the ISIS stronghold Raqqa to help launch the ISHS (the Islamic State Health Service), which appears to be mimicking Britain's National Health Service. The vision shows Yusuf handling babies in a maternity ward while wearing western-style blue surgical scrubs and a stethoscope. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . An Australian doctor who calls himself 'Abu Yusuf' is geatured in the latest Islamic State propaganda video in which the terrorist organisation announces the launch of the Islamic State Health Service . The video's poster shows a cropped image of a doctor, wearing an western-style blue surgical scrubs which appear to mimic Britain's National Health Service . The vision, which is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group, shows Yusuf interviewed inside the paediatric ward of a Syrian hospital. 'My name is Abu Yusuf. I made hijrah from Australia to the Islamic State to live under the khilafah,’ he says. 'I saw this as part of my jihad for Islam, to help the Muslim Ummah (community) in the area that I could which is the medical field.' He claims to be sad he delayed travelling to Syria for so long. ‘It is disappointing to think how many fellow Muslims brothers and sisters in the medical field, who are doctors and nurses, physios, who are still living in the West and unfortunately the Muslims living here are suffering, not necessary from a lack of equipment or medicine but a mainly a lack of qualified medical care.' Yusuf  is shown monitoring and handling babies in a maternity unit as well as teaching another doctor how to care for the infant patients . The vision is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group . Yusuf urges foreign Muslims with medical training to come forward and join the latest caliphate initiative. ‘We really need your help. It is not the equipment that we are lacking, it is truly just the staff. Inshallah see you soon.' The video also features an Indian physiologist called Abu Muqatil al-Hindi, who says the physical therapy centre is ‘one of them most important areas that any hospital should have.’ The physiologist says there are already Australian physiologists in the wing, but he encourages more doctors to travel to Syria to help the struggling medical service. The video also features an Indian physiologist called Abu Muqatil al-Hindi, who  encourages more doctors to travel to Syria to help the struggling medical service . Abu Yusuf al-Australi calls upon foreigners with medical training to join the Islamic State's new medical initiative . Australian National University terrorism expert Dr Clarke Jones confirmed the authenticity of the video to Daily Mail Australia. ‘I’m familiar with IS propaganda and this is certainly legit,' he said. ‘The video is interesting because it’s trying to communicate a sense of normalcy within the caliphate. The babies, ambulances and modern medical equipment are a far cry from the barbarity of their other videos.’ ‘In reality, the conditions are not accurate: Syria remains a very hostile environment. But it communicates a major shift in their recruitment.’ Dr Jones believes the group are trying to attract more sophisticated demographic than in the past, when they targeted disillusioned youths. ‘They are asking for foreigners with medical training and an education, and they aren’t trying to lure them for militant purposes. This poses an interesting question: is this still considered radicalisation?’ Nine British medical students have travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas.

The footage, which appeared on social media on Thursday, comes after nine Brritish medical students travelled to Syria last month, claiming they were going to help treat victims of the civil war. The students are all believed to be of Sudanese origin and were studying at a medical school in Khartoum, Sudan. The students have been named as Lena Mamoun Abdelgadir, Nada Sami Kader, Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Tasneem Suleyman Huseyin, Ismail Hamdoun, Tamer Ahmed Ebu Sebah, Mohammed Osama Badri Mohammed, Hisham Mohammed Fadlallah and Sami Ahmed Kadir. Former Melbourne man turned Islamic State recruiter Neil Prakash (above) has featured in recnt propaganda videos . In February, Australia's Attorney-General George Brandis announced an $18 million initiative to battle extremist propaganda. The operation, which will be launched in July, will employ a team of technology experts to assess the impact of online extremist propaganda. The government also plans to seek the help of platforms such as Google, Twitter and Facebook, to counter extremist messages. This week, senior Islamic State commander Abu Khaled al-Cambodi released a propaganda video where he ordered his 'beloved brothers' to 'rise up' and attack targets in Australia. The former Melbourne man was a key figure in police investigations surrounding a plot which was foiled last week which saw teenagers allegedly planning to attack police during today’s Anzac Day ceremony. Police have charged three men over  the shocking plot which would have seen a police officer run over and killed with a knife.

"As Prime Minister David Cameron puts it, on St George’s Day  we should ‘celebrate everything it is to be English’. But what does it mean to be English? From the Romans, Saxons and Normans many hundreds of years ago to those from Africa, the Indian sub-continent and the Philippines today, England has always been shaped by migration. To mark St George’s Day today, with a little help from WorldRemit, FEMAIL reveals the seemingly very English things that have actually been brought to England by people from abroad - and you may be surprised by the origins of your favourite things. Scroll down for video . Fish and chips has become a  British institution, as well as a national money-spinner, but it is actually believed to be partly Portuguese and partly Belgian . FISH AND CHIPS . They're a British institution as well as a national money-spinner, but how much do we really know about fish and chips? For most of us, the classic combination of battered fish and chipped potatoes deep-fried in beef fat or vegetable oil is as English as the cup of tea that washes it down. But just as tea originates in India or China, fish and chips is partly Portuguese and partly Belgian. The British can take credit for uniting these two Continental imports and creating a coupling that is loved the world over. One hundred and fifty years ago, in 1860, on the streets of the East End of London, 13-year-old Jewish boy called Joseph Malin had the bright idea of combining fried fish with chips. Joseph's family were rug weavers. To increase the family income they had begun frying chips in a downstairs room of their house. It was Joseph's idea to combine the chips - at that point a novelty in London - with fish from a nearby fried fish shop. Fried fish already had a long history in London. In a letter written at the end of the 18th Century, future American President Thomas Jefferson described eating 'fried fish in the Jewish fashion' on a visit to the capital. Battered fried fish had first arrived in London 200 years earlier with Jewish refugees from Portugal and Spain. They brought with them a way of cooking fish that would eventually become as British as Sherlock Holmes. The actual origins of polo are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia and was introduced to Brits by locals in the Indian state of Assam . By the 1830s, the imported novelty had established itself firmly as a favourite among London's poor. It was tasty, cheap and filling and could be eaten hot or cold. In 1846, a Jewish cookbook published in London included a recipe for fried fish. Eight years later, A Shilling Cookery For The People by French chef Alexis Soyer contained the first printed recipe for 'fried cooked potatoes'. The seal of respectability came when Victorian cook Eliza Acton, the forerunner of Mrs Beeton, suggested eating fried fish with vinegar to sweeten the taste. No one knows exactly how and where chips first originated. The most popular story credits a poor Belgian housewife from the Meuse Valley with their invention. In the winter of 1680, the river froze. Unable to get hold of any fish for her family, she cut potatoes into fish shapes and fried them instead. POLO . Is anything more English than rubbing shoulders with the high-rollers at a polo match at the height of summer? The actual origins of the game are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in  Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia. The first-ever recorded polo tournament was way back in 600BC when the Turkomans beat the Persians in a match. The game of polo spread quickly across the eastern world and became popular among Indians, who were introduced to the sport by the early Mohammedan invaders in the 13th century. Did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a New York tea merchant? Yet English plantation owners actually learned polo from locals in the Indian state of Assam in the 19th century. Later popularised by royalty, it became the sport of wealthy Englishmen. TEA . We all know the English love a good cuppa. A lot of people know that tea was first grown in China, which was then taken to India by the British. But did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a New York tea merchant? Invented by tea merchant Thomas Sullivan in New York City in June 1908, they can now be found in virtually every one of Britain's  homes. But if it wasn't for a handful of confused Americans, the tea bag may never have made it into our cups at all. They came about only after Mr Sullivan, in an attempt to cut costs, sent samples of tea leaves to potential customers in small silk pouch-like purses. Unsure quite what to do with the strange little bag, the Americans dunked it into a cup of hot water. And so was born the tea bag. After complaints that the mesh on the silk was too fine, Mr Sullivan developed sachets made of gauze - a method which was instrumental in today's tea bag design. But it was not until 1953, when British tea producer Tetley spotted the commercial potential of the bag, that it began to take off here. The firm now sells around 200million tea bags every week. PUBS . Long have the British population relished a pint in the local pub, but their creation is all thanks to the arrival of the Romans almost two thousand years ago. When they created the Roman road network, they opened little inns where a passer-by could enjoy a refreshing beverage en route to their destination. Originally called Tabernae, they began selling food and wine as well as ale. After the departure of the Romans, Alehouses began opening up all over the country. Saint George himself is thought to have been born in Syria during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD . ST GEORGE . Believe it or not, even Saint George himself is thought to have been born abroad during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD. Although historians have argued the Roman soldier's place of birth for over a century, it is believed that Saint George was born to a Greek Christian noble family in Syria. ENIGMA CODE . To many, the name Bletchley Park is synonymous with code-breaking glory by the British during World War Two. After all, it was there that Englishman Alan Turing and his team of mathematicians cracked the ciphers of the Nazis' Enigma machine - a feat credited with shortening the war by two years - and one depicted in award-winning movie The Imitation Game starring Keira Knightley and Benedict Cumberbatch. But in 2012, the Polish Government launched a campaign to highlight the important - and overlooked - role played by its nation in solving the Enigma code. Poles claim that Polish code breakers in Warsaw were the first ones to break Germany’s Enigma code by understanding the mathematics, left. People from Liverpool, like the Rooneys, right, are often called 'Scousers', which is short for ‘Lobscouse’, which was a Scandinavian stew eaten by the sailors who visited the port . In 1932, a group of cryptologists from the Polish Cipher Bureau - Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rozycki and Henryk Zygalski - discovered three ways of deciphering Enigma readings. Seven years later, just before war broke out, the Poles handed over their knowledge of the Enigma codes, as well as Polish-built replicas of the machines, to British and French Intelligence officers near Warsaw. SCOUSERS . People from Liverpool are often called ‘Scousers’. The name is short for ‘Lobscouse’, which was a Scandinavian stew eaten by the sailors who visited the port. Local families adopted the dish, and the name stuck.","Fish and chips has believed to be partly Portuguese and partly Belgian .

Saint George himself is thought to have been born in Syria .","The article explores the origins of various seemingly English traditions and customs, revealing their diverse and international roots. For instance, fish and chips have Portuguese and Belgian influences, while polo likely originated in Persia or Central Asia before being introduced to Brits by locals in Assam, India. Similarly, tea, pubs, Saint George, and the Enigma code all have connections to diverse locations and cultures beyond England's borders. These examples highlight the rich history of England and the influences of migration and international connections on its cultural identity."
"A 13-year-old Indian girl faced with an arranged marriage has written a letter to her teacher begging her to stop the wedding (stock image above) A 13-year-old Indian girl faced with an arranged marriage has written a letter to her teacher begging her to stop the wedding. Duli Hembrom wrote to the principal of Milan Mithi Uchha Vidyalaya after failing to convince her parents to call off the wedding, which is due to take place in two days. She wrote: 'I do not want to get married, I took an oath at the time of admission that I will not get married before I turn 18.' She added that she wanted the teacher to stop the marriage 'whichever way possible', the India Times reported. It is thought the 'oath' Duli refers to is the school's promise she had to make when she started, but exactly what it included is not known. Her father Lachhu, who lives in Gudibanda with Duli's mother, said child marriage was a common phenomenon in their society. He told the Hindustan Times that it was difficult to find a suitable match for a grown-up girl. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed in India during British rule in 1929, specified that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. But the country has the second highest number of child marriages, according to a UN report. Nearly 52 per cent of girls are married before reaching 18 years old, Indian records show. Between 2011 and 2020 more than 140 million girls will become child brides globally, analysts estimate. Aarati Benera, a women’s rights activist, described child marriage as 'illegal and a social evil'. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed in India during British rule in 1929, specified that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. Above, women and girls sit waiting to be married in a mass wedding ceremony in India . Despite numerous campaigns from many of the world's largest charities and NGOs, the issue of child brides remains a global concern. In 2013 there were around 57.5 million child brides across the world, 40 per cent of which married in India. This is despite the Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed  during British rule in 1929, specifying that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. Meanwhile, in Africa, 42 per cent of girls were married before turning 18 compared to 29 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean. The number of child brides is estimated to rise to 140 million by 2020 if current trends continue, 18.5 million of which will be under 15 years old, analysts warn. Statistics show that girls living in poor households are almost twice as likely to marry before 18 than girls in higher income households. And girls younger than 15 are also five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their 20s.

"Hillsborough investigators have launched an appeal to track down  fans who tended to the wounded as they lay dying on the pitch at the 1989 disaster. Photographs which show the men and woman rushing towards those crushed in the tragedy have been released, with investigators urging anyone who recognises them to come forward. They form part of an ongoing Home Office inquiry aiming to establish whether any individual or organisation was to blame for the disaster which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. Issued on behalf of the Coroner Sir John Goldring, the people in the photographs may be able to tell victims' families' more about how they died, officials said. Investigators have released these images of football fans who were pictured carrying the wounded on stretchers and tending to others at the 1989 Hillsborough disaster . Police say the 'unusual' appeal  is necessary as those photographed may be able to answer questions of the victims' families . 'It is important to stress that we believe these people can help the Coroner’s inquest process,' said Assistant Commissioner Jon Stoddart of Operation Resolve, the police force set up to look into the disaster. 'I know these pictures are 26 years old but if anyone does recognise the people we need to speak to then I would urge them to get in touch immediately. 'There are still many questions that the families of the 96 have and we believe that these people may be able to provide answers to some of those questions.' Ninety-six people died at the disaster after Liverpool fans in one section of the football grounds became crushed. Previous inquests which recorded conclusions of accidental death were thrown out at the High Court in 2012 after years of campaigning by the families of those killed. The Home Secretary Theresa May launched a fresh probe into the disaster the same year. Investigators hope members of the public may recognise some of those pictured in the appeal released today .

'I have a team of highly trained staff in place who will deal with witnesses sensitively as we understand how difficult some people will find this,' added Mr Stoddart. 'The Operation Resolve website also contains useful contacts should members of the public require welfare assistance. 'It is unusual to carry out an appeal of this nature during an ongoing legal process such as the inquests and for that reason I urge people to remember the warning issued by the Coroner at the start of the fresh inquests, which he reiterated in February 2014. 'I also urge people to consider the advisory notice issued by the Attorney General’s office on 10 March 2014. 'It is really important that people do not pass comment on our appeal or any other aspect of the Hillsborough disaster on social media and forums.' Among those to have already given evidence at the inquest in Warrington are the families of those killed and police officers working at the time. The inquest continues.

"(CNN)Sunday's announcement that Corinthian Colleges Inc. would shut down all of its remaining 28 campuses is a positive development in a long struggle to hold for-profit colleges accountable. Corinthian, which once enrolled more than 70,000 students, is one of the worst of the ""predator colleges"" -- schools that offer dubious degrees, saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year. Many of these schools are for-profit career colleges that operate mostly online. It's no wonder that Corinthian is doing this after the U.S. Department of Education curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer. There are about 1.3 million students enrolled in for-profit colleges, many of which have questionable track records, and their students need help transitioning into legitimate postsecondary schools. With Uncle Sam's student loan debt sheet topping $1 trillion, we literally can't afford to continue funding for-profit colleges -- which reportedly get 86% of their funding from federal student loan money. For those not familiar with the for-profit college fiasco, here's the whole story in one telling statistic: While for-profit colleges enroll only 13% of the nation's college students, such colleges account for nearly half of all student loan defaults, according to Department of Education statistics. For comparison's sake, the default rate of for-profit college students is worse than the default rate of the worst subprime borrowers during the financial crisis. How do these colleges operate? It's deviously simple: Convince low-income students into borrowing tens of thousands of dollars through easy federal student loans, keep costs low through online classes and part-time professors, and watch the money roll in. The aggressive tactics of these colleges boggle the mind. Recruiters are told to make 100 phone calls and leave 100 messages a day, according to a ProPublica investigation. I can personally attest to the aggressive tactics. My phone number was accidentally placed on a call list for a for-profit college recently, and I received so many calls per day that I had to ask my wireless carrier to block the phone number. Stopping the exploitation of students isn't easy. The for-profit college business is a multibillion-dollar industry. The CEOs of these companies make millions of dollars a year, employ an army of lobbyists and donate money to both political parties. But the past two months brought a new twist to the crisis. Hundreds of graduates of the now-defunct Corinthian joined a ""debt strike,"" publicly declaring their refusal to pay back their loans. In response, Education Department Secretary Arne Duncan signaled a willingness to forgive loans of Corinthian graduates who have crushing debt and no job prospects. Now that Corinthian is finally shutting down, we must finish the job. The remaining for-profit colleges should be closed. Any student not gainfully employed or transferred to a reputable college within three years should be considered a victim, and their debts should be forgiven. Yes, ""victim"" is the right word. If these degrees actually helped people get jobs, we should be celebrating them. But according to a jaw-dropping report by the Education Department, the average graduate of an online for-profit college makes less than a high school dropout. Not the equivalent of a high school dropout. Less than a high school dropout. The real-life misery caused by predatory colleges is painful to hear about. One Corinthian graduate has $37,000 in debt for his computer science degree, but he can't even get a job at Best Buy, according to Slate. Another graduate, $33,000 in debt, has a medical assisting degree, but she gave up on finding employment in her field. She waits tables now, The Chronicle of Higher Education says. I can already hear your next question. If for-profit colleges are this terrible, are they at least cheaper? No. In fact, their cost is reportedly around 60% higher than a comparable degree from a public college. What's even more frustrating is that we've known about the shenanigans of these predator colleges for years. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office found widespread rule breaking by the largest for-profit colleges -- everything from accepting fictitious high-school diplomas to encouraging plagiarism and cheating. In one example, an undercover federal investigator posing as a student was told by a professor, ""It's not hard to get a 100% on the second try; just jot down the correct answers and take the quiz again,"" according to The New York Times. In 2013, Career Education Corp. paid $10 million to settle charges by the state of New York regarding phony job-placement claims. All told, no fewer than 36 state attorneys general were investigating for-profit colleges in 2014. After selling off 95 of its campuses last year, Corinthian said on Sunday that it tried unsuccessfully to sell the remaining 28 campuses, blaming the failure on ""federal and state regulators seeking to impose financial penalties and conditions"" on potential buyers. You can't hide your bad behavior forever, and the questionable practices of many for-profit colleges are starting to catch up with them. Enrollment at the University of Phoenix -- the largest for-profit college in the United States -- has fallen by half, to about 213,000. We laid the smackdown on predatory lenders during the financial crisis, and it's time to do the same thing with for-profit colleges. To keep predator colleges from wrecking our faith in the college degree -- still the best pathway to a middle-class life -- we need to act now. For-profit colleges have flunked their final exam. Now it's up to their rich benefactor, Uncle Sam, to make sure they don't go back to school in the fall. Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article said the San Diego campus of the University of Phoenix had been banned from enrolling military veterans last year; that issue has been resolved.","David Wheeler: Corinthian, considered a ""predator"" school, will shut down campuses .
Wheeler: Students of for-profit colleges are hapless victims; their debts should be forgiven .","Corinthian Colleges Inc. closing down its remaining campuses is seen as a positive step in holding for-profit colleges accountable for offering dubious degrees and exploiting students with high levels of debt. These colleges are largely funded by federal student loan money and have high student loan default rates. The closure of Corinthian's campuses sheds light on the exploitative practices of for-profit colleges, prompting a call for stricter regulations and potential loan forgiveness for affected students. The article highlights the need for action to protect students from predatory colleges and emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability in the for-profit college industry."

"Faris Al-Khori, 62, was found with a hoard of explosive ingredients and recipes for bombs in his flats . A former Syrian doctor has been jailed after police discovered a hoard of explosive ingredients and bomb-making instructions at his home. Faris Al-Khori had dozens of chemicals, poisonous materials, bolts and handwritten notes on how to make a bomb, a court heard. The equipment was found purely by chance in April last year after a fire at a block of flats in the Muirhouse area of Edinburgh. Firefighters, who were responding to a 999 call over a fire within a rubbish chute on the 11th floor, had forced entry to a flat registered to Al-Khori and found jars containing various powders. Castor beans, which can be used to make ricin, were also found. The building was evacuated while the police and army Explosive Ordnance Device (EOD) experts were called in to test the substances - some of which were years old. Al-Khori also had a small amount of a highly volatile explosive lead picrate which was so dangerous that the Forensic Explosives Laboratory refused to take delivery of it and it was destroyed. A search was carried out at a further block where the 62-year-old lived with his wife in Leith and a further haul of material was recovered. Both blocks of flats were evacuated and the areas around them sealed off. Al-Khori said the materials were used for cleaning and as fertiliser but in February he pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 Explosive Substances Act. Police seized bomb-making instructions and equipment including a bag containing an electrical circuit (pictured) from the properties . Two Coleman's Mustard jars were found being used to store a small amount of a highly volatile explosive, lead picrate . Sentencing him to three years and four months in prison, Judge Lady Wolffe said: 'You assembled large quantities without lawful purpose and some were stored in a high rise flat in a densely populated area. 'The number and nature of the explosive substances and the places you chose to store them lead me to conclude there is no alternative to a custodial sentence.' The court heard that much of the bomb-making equipment, which also included electrical circuits, had been ordered from online retailers. Defence QC Brian McConnachie said: 'What seems to be clear from the narrative and material is that it has been directly ordered from legitimate companies, mainly through Amazon. 'The material has always been delivered to domestic addresses and paid for by genuine credit cards registered to Mr al-Khori. 'It has always been done in the open and over a period of time. Many of the items have never been opened. Al-Khori pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 Explosive Substances Act after officers seized dozens of explosive ingredients . 'It is difficult to understand the hoarding of this material but it does appear that he is someone who has some kind of academic interest in the materials. 'It seems he has accumulated materials with some kind of peculiar interest in the subject without ever intending to do anything or make anything.' Detective Superintendent David Gordon, who led the investigation, said: 'This was a significant and complex inquiry for Police Scotland, to safely deal with these volatile items and seek to establish Al-Khori's motives for storing them. 'A thorough investigation by the Organised Crime and Counter Terrorism Unit and Crown Office found no known links to terrorist offences and we believe Faris Al-Khori was acting independently. However, he showed utter disregard for the occupants of both buildings. 'Thanks to the swift actions of our partners in the Fire Service and armed forces, we were able to quickly assess the contents of the flats and make them safe by removing a number of items for forensic examination or controlled explosion. The items from the flats in Edinburgh were discovered by chance during a fire within the rubbish chute which was then evacuated whilst the items were recovered . 'I am also grateful to the City of Edinburgh Council for their work to re-house vulnerable residents whilst we carried out our searches. 'Public safety was at the forefront of our response to this incident and all agencies worked together to minimise any risk to the public. 'Al-Khori's activities went unnoticed for many years, demonstrating the importance of community vigilance in our efforts to keep Scotland safe. 'Counter terrorism is one of Police Scotland's highest priorities, and whilst Al-Khori has no such known links we will always treat all information received with the utmost importance where any risk to the public is identified.' Al-Khori, who was born in Damascus and raised in a Christian family, trained as a doctor in Iraq but has never practised medicine in Britain after arriving here in 1984. He was the full-time carer for his wife, who suffers from schizophrenia, and has had British citizenship since 1998. Police and army Explosive Ordnance Device (EOD) experts had to be called in to remove the explosive materials . Lindsey Miller, the Crown Office's Procurator Fiscal for Organised Crime and Counter-Terrorism, added: 'The conviction of Al-Khori is a good example of agencies working closely together to protect the public. 'Al-Khori possessed a significant number and volume of explosive substances across two properties in Edinburgh as well as recipes for explosives. 'We worked closely with Police Service of Scotland and other agencies to prepare the case to ensure that Al-Khori was brought to justice.' 'I want to reassure the people of Scotland that we take any such offences extremely seriously, and our specialist prosecutors will continue to treat them as an absolute priority.'","Faris Al-Khori, 62, was found with dozens of bomb-making ingredients .

"David Cameron will say that high taxes are 'immoral' as 14 million working households receive a tax cut . David Cameron will say today that high taxes and wasteful government spending are ‘immoral’ as millions receive a tax cut. As 14million working households – more than nine in ten – are given an average boost of £200 a year to their incomes, the Prime Minister will set out the Conservative case for people keeping more of their own money – because they ‘know best’ how it should be spent. And he will make a bold argument for continued lower taxes, with less spent on ‘bureaucracy’ and ‘crackpot Government schemes’. ‘There is no such thing as public money, there is only taxpayers’ money,’ he will say. ‘And we believe it’s people – not politicians – who know best how to spend their own money. And that’s what today is all about.’ He will add that it is ‘wrong – frankly immoral – for Government to spend money like it grows on trees’. Among the raft of changes coming into effect today, on what Mr Cameron will dub ‘money back Monday’, are: . Other measures to encourage saving will also begin, with the Isa limit increasing to £15,240 and the 10p savings tax band abolished. Treasury analysis shows the changes will benefit 14million working households to the tune of £17 a month. And nearly million pensioner households – more than nine in ten – will benefit by £15 a month. Middle income households earning around £23,000 a year will benefit the most, and the top ten per cent of earners the least. Today will also see the abolition of the old pensions annuities, allowing retirement money to be accessed like a current account. Mr Cameron will say the changes make Britain a ‘better and fairer place to live’, adding that low taxes ‘go to the heart of what I believe as a Conservative. ‘For me, there’s the economic case: That, in a competitive world, we need to incentivise work by making it pay. ‘There’s the progressive case: That the best way to help with living standards is to let people keep more of the money they earn. ‘But above all, there is the moral case: That it is wrong – frankly immoral – for Government to spend money like it grows on trees.’ He will also pledge to eliminate the deficit ‘without reaching into working people’s pockets like Labour would’. However, in a speech in Yorkshire, Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will point to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing families are £1,100 a year worse off over the past five years as a result of government tax and spending changes. And he will warn that the Conservatives will raise VAT. Mr Balls will say: ‘David Cameron and George Osborne are going round the country telling people they’ve never had it so good. How out of touch can they get? ‘The truth is millions are worse off because of this government’s choices. ‘And while millions are paying more, millionaires are paying less. Two years ago today they gave the top one per cent of earners in our country a £3billion a year tax cut.’ Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will point to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing families are £1,100 a year worse off over the past five years as a result of government tax and spending changes . The Lib Dems said that the changes to income tax had been part of their manifesto and said Labour would cost 24million taxpayers £340 a year. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will say today: ‘In government, we secured a tax cut totalling £825 every year for millions of ordinary working people. We now plan to take this further, raising the [tax-free personal allowance] threshold to £12,500 and giving millions of people a further tax cut worth nearly £400.’","More than nine in ten working households will receive a tax cut from today .

"Police say they have no objections to the late afternoon kick-off for Sunday's Manchester derby at Old Trafford. With plenty at stake for both United and City – both sides are challenging for a top-four spot in the Premier League – some may feel that the 4pm start could be unwise as it allows supporters more time in the pub. However, the man in charge of patrolling the sell-out clash has no such fears. Police say they have no objections to Sunday's Manchester derby taking place in the late afternoon . Chief Superintendent John O'Hare says the kick-off was agreed by all parties and revealed that the decision is down to good behaviour from supporters of each side. 'We have not objected to the 4pm kick-off time at all,' he told Sportsmail. 'That 4pm has been agreed is testament to the excellent behaviour of the overwhelming majority of fans who have attended previous derby fixtures. 'It is the positive behaviour of both sets of fans at previous derby fixtures that means we feel confident this Sunday’s fixture will continue that tradition of the fixture being a safe and enjoyable one.' Rio Ferdinand was hit by an object thrown from the crowd during the Manchester derby in December 2012 . In February, Merseyside Police launched a legal challenge after the Everton v Liverpool match, which was also televised, was chosen for a 5.30pm start although they later withdrew their objection. Police in Manchester have met representatives from supporters groups representing each club and agreed a series of measures. Inside the ground fans in and close to the away end will be limited to two drinks every time they visit the bar. No street drinking will be allowed while police will also be searching supporters and keeping an eye out for pyrotechnics. GMP also say they have no intention to hold back City supporters at the final whistle but add that this could be reviewed on the day. Footage on You Tube showed the unrest when United played City in a late kick-off at Wembley in 2011 . City won that FA Cup semi-final, but 34 arrests were made due to crowd trouble outside the stadium . The last time United and City met in a late kick-off for a weekend match was in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley in 2011. That clash, won by City 1-0, started at 5.15pm and was marred by a series of skirmishes on Wembley Way and on coach parks close to the stadium with 34 arrests made amid scenes some fans described as 'a free for all'. The last late afternoon kick-off in Manchester was for a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford in 2004. After November's derby at the Etihad Stadium, won 1-0 by City, video footage captured dozens of fans fighting outside a nearby pub around 90 minutes after the final whistle.

"Crawling commando-style underneath an open-sided Land Rover, I came virtually nose to nose with a 4,500lb horned rhino. I tried to slow my breathing as she looked straight at me. I needed to be calm to take my shot. There were three other rhinos with her and, let's be honest, they're not called a crash of rhino for nothing. I raised my camera and began to photograph what could soon become an extinct pachyderm. The luxurious Ulusaba Game Reserve is  in South Africa's Sabi Sands and is Sir Richard Branson's private reserve . Thankfully the female found my scrawny presence of absolutely no consequence, and instead wandered off in search of tastier herbivorous options. I was with my mate James and we laughed awkwardly as we climbed back into the vehicle. My mum – Sky TV presenter Kay Burley – was sitting statue-still on board, having adopted her best nonchalant expression, but she wasn't fooling either of us. The holiday at Ulusaba, Sir Richard Branson's private game reserve in South Africa's Sabi Sands, was my reward for graduating. I have been on safari before but this was different. I'm an amateur car photographer and wanted to swap taking photos of Ferraris and focus instead on the roar of a bush lion, the yawn of a hippo, the prowl of a glorious leopard or a close-up of a fearless rhino. We achieved all of them. Kutner came face to face with three rhinos, along with documenting the roar of a bush lion, the yawn of a hippo and the prowl of a glorious leopard . Just the day before, we had tracked the crash of rhino on foot. With 1,000 rhinos killed by poachers in South Africa last year alone, they are increasingly difficult to view. Danny, our brilliant tracker, who could find a spelling mistake in a dictionary, had eventually located them, but with dusk fast approaching we reluctantly headed back to the Land Rover. The African bush is not a place to be on foot in the dark. We should know. We'd spent the earlier part of the day up close and personal with a pride of lions. Our ranger, Trevor, steered the Land Rover as close as he dared without disturbing the big cats. The lioness, who could have taken any one of us out with a casual swipe of her front paw, looked in our direction, checked her cubs and allowed us to stay. Trevor, also a photographer, whispered advice on appropriate settings for my Nikon D600 to achieve the best results. Heading back to the luxury accommodation at Cliff Lodge, a two-bedroom apartment within Rock Lodge (Mum described it as glamping but with solid walls, luxury furnishings, soft sheets and a chef to conjure up our favourite food), we talked about all the other animals we wanted to see, if possible. Alexander Kutner with mum, Sky TV presenter Kay Burley, at Ulusaba, Sir Richard Branson's private game reserve in South Africa's Sabi Sands . Trevor said he and Danny would try but couldn't promise anything. Nevertheless, given the conservation, ecology and anti-poaching work being carried out by Ulusaba and adjoining camps, we were feeling confident. The following day we found ourselves slap bang in the middle of a herd of buffalo, mean-looking guys who glare at you as if you owe them money. Danny, who will happily track on foot for lion, leopard, elephant and rhino – four of the Big Five – makes an exception for buffalo. Alexander said a lioness looked in his group's direction, checked her cubs and allowed them to stay . Trevor started up the engine and we moved on. Pausing at a watering hole, we were delighted to see two young male elephants wandering towards us. They made their way into the water and proceeded to perform for us – a photographer's dream! We returned to the lodge to relax and sort through the hundreds of photos we'd captured. Chef served up kudu burgers for lunch. We'd seen plenty of these handsome antelope during our morning game drive… and Mum decided to pass on that meal. Ulusaba means 'place of little fear'. That's because the koppie where Rock Lodge sits provided the ancient Shangaan warriors with the perfect lookout point . Trevor wondered what else we'd like to see. 'Cheetah, please,' we cried. He took us on a long, bumpy drive to the wide-open plains where cheetah can run free in their hunt for food. They are extremely rare in this area of the Sabi Sands and, despite hour after hour of tracking, there were no paw-print clues. However, Trevor had one last surprise. Danny heard the call of a honey bird and a solitary warning from an impala antelope. These led him on foot to a pair of leopard cubs frolicking up a tree. There is no sighting quite as magical as a leopard, and six-month-old cubs are the perfect age to provide incredible images of their playful behaviour. Eventually, with a heavy heart and my camera packed away, we left the African bush. Until the next time...

"The mother of a pregnant woman who woke up from a four-month coma earlier this month said she knew doctors were wrong when they told her that her 20-year-old daughter wouldn't wake up. Anna Moser's daughter Sharista Giles of Sweetwater, Tennessee, was driving home from a concert in December with friends when a car accident sent her to the hospital with injuries so bad doctors believed she would never recover. She was five months pregnant at the time and in January doctors were forced to deliver the baby early, a little boy the family has named Leighton Isiah Giles. Scroll down for video .

'He showed her a picture of her baby, and she followed the picture,' said her mother, Beverly. 'When he turned around to put it back on the bulletin board, she turned her neck, her whole head trying to follow and find the picture again.' And Moser remained hopeful, but not entirely optimistic, until she started speaking to Giles a few nights ago. 'I said, ""If you could get out of that bed right now, I could take you home,"" and her head come up. And she had never did that, it was plumb off the bed,' Moser told WATE. 'That's when I knew.'

"(CNN)I would have done anything to get to Europe. It was worth the risk, the bad treatment and the fear, hard as that may be to believe. Simply put, I have a better life now than I did before. But my journey across the Mediterranean, like those of thousands of other migrants, wasn't easy. Here's my story. It all started late last year when I lost my job in Dubai. My work visa had expired, and I had nowhere else to go. I'm Syrian, and returning to Syria wasn't an option -- going back means you either have to kill or be killed. But Syrians don't need visas to get into Turkey, so Turkey it was. I arrived in the country in December with an old dream in my mind: reaching Europe. While in Istanbul, I discovered many Facebook pages about illegal smuggling from Turkey to Italy by sea. All of them mentioned that Mersin, a port city on the southern border, was the jump off point, so I made my way there. I met a Syrian guy in a hotel in Mersin who had already paid money to one smuggler and was planning to depart within a few days. He told me his smuggler was a decent man with a great reputation. Reputation: It was a funny thing to hear for the first time, the thought that these people, who I always considered to be little more than criminals, were concerned about what people thought of them. But why wouldn't they be? It's a long-term business, and the Syrian conflict isn't ending anytime soon. So I decided to meet the guy. We spoke about terms of payment and agreed on a fee of $6,500. Some of the money would be deposited into an insurance company, with the usual transaction fees. When I reached Italy the money would be released to the smuggler -- or, if I changed my mind, I'd be able to get some of it back. ""Be ready all day, every day for the next few days, because you might receive the call to go,"" the smuggler told me. One evening a few days later, I got the call and my journey began. They gathered 100 men and women in five buses and drove us to the smuggling point. It was far from Mersin. We walked for 30 minutes, through rough terrain and orange farms near the beach, in darkness to avoid detection by police. The idea was to take us in three small boats to the main ship. I still remember an old lady, barely able to walk, with her two sons, marching along as fast as they could to try to reach the boats. They were told that if they didn't walk faster, the boat would leave without them. I asked myself so many time what could possibly drive a normal person to put himself and his family in this kind of danger. I decided that anyone with a past but no future was capable of doing crazy things. Finally we reached the boat. It was just as the smuggler described. For three days we waited in the boat for two other parties of 100 people to join us before departing. We were in the middle of the Mediterranean, far enough away from the surrounding countries to be in international waters. On the fourth day we started our journey with a mix of excitement and fear -- fear that this madness often ends in tragedy, ends with us as numbers piled on top of all the other unfortunate, nameless numbers who never made it to the other side. But there was no going back -- it's a one-way ticket. We sailed for eight hours before the boat's engine broke down. There were around 300 of us on board, and as the waves began to push us towards Cyprus the crew sent a distress signal, hoping to alert maybe a U.N. or Red Cross boat, anyone who could help us. Eventually our boat hit a cliff and got stuck. Luckily, before long, a Cypriot coast guard ship arrived to rescue us and deport us back to Turkey. Turkish authorities fingerprinted and released us within a few hours. Some of the people I had been traveling with said they weren't going to try to make the trip again. When they asked me what I planned to do, I told them I would do it again tomorrow if I could -- another journey through a sea where no prayer works, where no one is bigger than nature, where you can feel so small, no matter how big your dreams are. I'd already lost everything. My family didn't know what I was doing, but I dreamed of being a human being who is treated like one. I wasn't going to stop. So I called the smuggler the same night I was released, and said I wanted to get on the next ship out. Two days later I received the call, and again I headed to a smuggling point. This time, they had a bigger boat -- a cargo ship, in fact, maybe 85 meters long or more. It took five days to get everyone on board the ship -- 391 of us in total, refugees from cities all over Syria. And for the first time, I began to feel like I was in jail, trapped in conditions no human should ever suffer. We lived in the hold. There were no mattresses or sheets, but we found some wooden planks to put our stuff on to keep it from getting wet. Hundreds of migrants killed when boat capsizes . For five days we had no food and little water. But at least it meant not having to make frequent trips to the ""toilet,"" if you could call it that, which was an old car tire covered with a piece of cloth. Huge waves crashed against the ship from all angles and water leaked in from the ceiling as we slept on the cold metal floor of the ship, the smell of urine emanating from the corner. Seven days in, despite the poor conditions, everything was going well and we were nearing the island-dotted seas near Greece. On the eleventh day, 200 miles off the coast of southern Italy our guides began to alert Italian authorities to our presence. We were adrift at sea, they told the authorities, with no captain or crew. And that was actually true -- we didn't have a registered pilot, just one guy who had worked on this ship before. An Icelandic ship -- working in conjunction with Frontex, the joint European Union border patrol -- rescued us from our captain-less boat with the help of a scientific research boat from New Zealand. The rescue ship approached us but was unable to get close at first because the waves were so high. We knew we would have to wait some time before leaving our boat forever. The other refugees were waving their hands like children and then telling each other: ""Stop waving, they've already seen us."" I was one of the last 10 people to be rescued from the boat. I can still see it like it was yesterday; it was the rebirth of a new life. Why migrants head to Mediterranean . They took us to Catania, on Sicily, where we finally reached land a day later. When we arrived, the first thing the Italian authorities did was look after the urgent medical cases. There was a man who was poisoned by the drinking water on the boat, a few pregnant women and old people who needed medical attention. They took us to a refugee camp and the only thing anyone talked about was being fingerprinted. They were saying: ""We didn't risk everything to be refugees. We are not going to give our fingerprints, even if they torture us."" Later that night a Moroccan-Italian man told us not to worry: ""They will not fingerprint you."" They would simply take us to different camps and we could leave from there. Twelve days after it began, our journey to Europe was over. I spent two days in Sicily before making my way first to Milan with two Syrian guys who had become friends. We decided to go to Germany and went to Paris first and ended up in a city called Saarbrucken. I didn't know where my fellow travellers were heading, but I knew one thing: my dream of making it to Europe, no matter the cost and risk involved, had been achieved. It was worth it.","Moutassem Yazbek describes harrowing 12-day journey from Turkey to Italy .

"A cleaner who feared a body he found was a murder victim had in fact found a  900-year-old mummy. The preserved remains were discovered in a cardboard box by street cleaners in north-western Peru.

"Hundreds of passengers on a New York City subway train were evacuated from cars in an underwater tunnel after a fire during the Monday morning commute. A train heading from Queens into Manhattan was stalled underneath the East River around 8.30am Monday morning and its conductor saw smoke coming from the board along the track's third rail. The train's 542 passengers were taken by a rescue train to Grand Central Station in Manhattan, an MTA spokesman told Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video . Service on a New York City subway line (pictured) was suspended for almost two hours after smoke in an underwater tunnel left hundreds of passengers stuck beneath the East River . More than 500 passengers were taken to Manhattan after spending roughly an hour and a half trapped. They walked through their stalled train into a rescue train and left around 10am . Part of the train's contact shoe, which gets power from the third rail, is thought to have touched the board instead of the rail, sparking the incident that left service on the 7 train suspended for just less than two hours. The last of the passengers were taken on to the new train around 10am, according to AMNY. No injuries were reported beyond a woman who felt faint and requested medical attention. The MTA has warned passengers to expect delays on other lines such as the N,Q, and R.

"Wasps made an honourable and defiant exit from the Champions Cup on Sunday as they took the holders to the wire and may have clinched a seismic upset, but for a glaring official oversight. Dai Young’s side became the third of four English challengers to be dispatched from Europe’s premier event over a punishing weekend, but this was no meek capitulation. Despite the chronic inconvenience of losing Nathan Hughes to a contentious ban and Christian Wade to an untimely injury, the visitors raged gallantly against the dying of the light. Ali Williams crosses for a late try for Toulon as they put victory over Wasps on Sunday beyond doubt . New Zealander Williams rises to celebrate his try which came minutes after he should have been sin-binned .

Davies, Goode, Leiua. Tries: Helu (2) Conversions: Goode. Penalties: Lozowski (2) Referee: George Clancy (Ireland) Toulon are back-to-back continental champions, awash with Test talent, but they were given a scare by their tenacious opponents — and even forced to adopt sly, illegal tactics to survive a second-half fightback. Seven minutes from full-time amid a cacophony at Stade Felix Mayol, Wasps launched a daring raid from their own 22 which eventually culminated in a second try for Will Helu, but it also featured a miscarriage of justice. Former All Black lock Ali Williams pulled back Elliot Daly off the ball as he ran clear in support of Joe Simpson. It was surely one of the most obvious offences of its type ever committed in the sport, yet Williams not only avoided a yellow card, but he was on hand to touch down three minutes from time for the try which distorted the final scoreline. Wasps were left battered and beaten, but richly deserving of the ovations from their pockets of supporters around the ground. Captain James Haskell’s work-load was worthy of three men and Andrea Masi also gave body and soul to the cause, while Simpson and Daly were outstanding.

Young was delighted with how his side had performed, once they stopped being so deferential. ‘I’m really proud of the effort and the commitment,’ he said. ‘There was real frustration in the first half, because we gave them a bit too much respect in the first 30 minutes. We were a little bit frantic, a little bit panicky, but we will learn from that and I thought we played some really good stuff on occasions. I’m pleased that we were in it right to the end.’ Wasps defence descend on Toulon's Guilhem Guirado at the Felix Mayol Stadium on Sunday . Toulon speedster Delon Armitage makes a break for the defending champions . Lozowski makes a diving pass while his ankle is grasped by the Toulon player on the ground . Asked about Williams’ illegal tug on Daly’s shirt, Young added: ‘There were three people (in the ground) who didn’t see it… the referee and the two touch judges.’ Toulon went ahead when Mathieu Bastareaud blasted over the line from close range in the eighth minute and, as their pack took control, Frederic Michalak was able to dispatch five first-half penalties. The Top 14 leaders went into the break 22-6 up, but Wasps turned the tables as Daly scorched down the right to tee up Helu’s first try. Michalak’s sixth penalty appeared to settle the holders, but Helu touched down for the second time after another crucial intervention by the outstanding Daly. When Williams went over to quell the uprising moments later, it secured Toulon a semi-final against Leinster in Marseille, and left Wasps to head home craving another shot at this tournament next season.","Toulon beat Wasps in their European Rugby Champions Cup quarter-final .

"Jonathan Trott's first innings on his return to Test cricket for the first time in 17 months was brief and unsuccessful, as he was caught at first slip just three balls in. Trott last played a Test for his country in November 2013, when he withdrew from England's disastrous Ashes tour with a stress-related illness. But his much-anticipated return, this time as captain Alastair Cook's opening partner, was over almost before it had begun when he nicked Jerome Taylor to Darren Bravo.

"A Briton jailed in Burma for using an image of the Buddha to promote his bar has been ‘abandoned’ by the Foreign Office, according to human rights campaigners. Phil Blackwood was sentenced to two-and-a-half years with hard labour by a Burmese court last month after posting the mocked-up image of the Buddha wearing DJ headphones on Facebook. The tongue-in-cheek advert for a cheap-drinks night at the VGastro bar in Rangoon provoked outrage among devout Buddhists. Scroll down for video . Phil Blackwood (left) was sentenced to two-and-a-half years with hard labour by a Burmese court last month after posting a mocked-up image of Buddha wearing DJ headphones on Facebook. Human rights campaigners claim he has been 'abandoned' by the Foreign Office . The 32-year-old bar manager, who has dual New Zealand and British nationality, was found guilty of insulting religion along with the bar’s Burmese owner and another manager, despite apologising profusely for posting the picture. All three were given the same sentence. MPs and human rights campaigners said Mr Blackwood, who is married with a young daughter, is enduring appalling conditions in the notorious Insein prison. They also claimed the British Government had ‘turned its back’ on Mr Blackwood, who lived in Middlesbrough until his family moved to New Zealand when he was four. The 32-year-old bar manager, who has dual New Zealand and British nationality, was found guilty of insulting religion because of this picture . In a Commons answer, a Foreign Office Minister admitted he was not aware Mr Blackwood was a British citizen. Last night, his father Brian insisted that the family had informed the British authorities of his son’s dual nationality after his arrest. Although New Zealand diplomats were taking the lead, he said that the family expected the Foreign Office to exert pressure on Burma. Middlesbrough MP Andy McDonald said: 'Philip Blackwood has been unjustly imprisoned for an honest mistake for which he has already issued a heartfelt apology. 'As a British citizen, rather than turning their back on Mr Blackwood, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office should be pulling every available leaver to secure his immediate and unconditional release so that he can return to his family.' There is international concern over a surge of religious nationalism in Burma, ruled until recently by a military junta. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: ‘Our ambassador in Burma made clear that we were following the case closely when he raised it with the Burmese Minister of the Presidency. ‘Our embassy in Rangoon has provided advice and support to the New Zealanders on Mr Blackwood’s case.’","Phil Blackwood was sentenced to two-and-a-half years with hard labour .

"Ronald Koeman called for Southampton's players to show maturity, nous and respect after Victor Wanyama's future came under question. This weekend brings with it arguably Saints' biggest match of the season, with the visit of Tottenham likely to be key in the fight for European qualification. Mauricio Pochettino's first return to St Mary's adds extra spice to a match, ahead of which his successor felt the need to hold a team meeting to refocus his players' minds. Ronald Koeman says his Southampton players must remain focused on European qualification . Koeman spoke to Victor Wanyama and his other players to refocus them on the last five league games . Wanyama's claims that Arsenal were interested in his services were the catalyst and, while defending the 23-year-old by saying the story was 'bull****', Koeman called for his players to show more common sense. 'You know always in the last part of the season there are rumours talking about interest in players,' the Saints boss said. 'I don't like to say every time it's true or it's not true. 'It's important that everybody knows his position in the club. They have contracts - you can't talk about moving because you have a contract. That's not respectful to the club. 'We spoke about that, that we need that focus. If we don't have really that focus, we can't bring the level what we normally bring this season.' Such speculation about the likes of Wanyama, Nathaniel Clyne and Morgan Schneidelin brings back memories of last summer's talent drain from St Mary's. Wanyama's future came under question after an interview where he seemed to hint at a move to Arsenal . Koeman has repeatedly insisted a similar situation will not arise this time around, although he is wise enough to know the south-coast club's place in the food chain. 'On one side it's normal because, okay, we are Southampton,' Koeman said. 'We are not Man United, because they are always talking about new players, and normally in teams like Southampton, a little bit more down, they are talking about interest in players of Southampton. 'We know that, but it's up to the press. They can write and they can say what they want, but no problem. 'We have to keep that spirit together and that was my message to the players. 'We can't do anything about that. You have to look out if they ask you that kind of questions. That's your job. There has also been speculation about the futures of Morgan Schneiderlin (left) and Nathaniel Clyne . Southampton come up against former boss Mauricio Pochettino on Saturday in the race for the Europa League . 'You're not a young kid. You have to respond, and if you respond you have to know what you respond.' Koeman says he will not be enforcing a media ban to keep his players out of trouble - something he accepts is more difficult now given the power held by agents. The former Holland international also understands the ambitions his players may well harbour, admitting he spoke out of turn a few times when he was younger. 'Of course, when I played in Holland, okay, I was looking to play in a bigger team - that's normal,' Koeman said. 'If you are not really in the highest level and you get opportunities to play in a higher level, okay, you like it, of course. Everybody likes the best. 'Everybody likes to play Champions League football - that's normal. I'm not surprised about that.'","Ronald Koeman has urged his team to focus on European qualification .

"A Wisconsin church's four-decade tradition of people mud-wrestling pigs at a summer fundraiser has been cancelled after complaints the animals were 'punched in the face, body slammed and jumped on'. St Patrick's Parish in Stephensville, Wisconsin said in a statement that the Original Pig Rassle will be replaced this  August with a human mud foosball tournament. Global Conservation Group, an animal advocacy group, launched an online petition claiming the tournament was inhumane to the pigs. It garnered more than 81,000 signatures in efforts to cancel the event. Deacon Ken Bilgrien of St Patrick's Parish told Christian Today on Wednesday that the church is moving in a different direction for its 45th annual Roundup, but declined to discuss the controversy surrounding the event. Scroll down for video . St Patrick's Parish in Stephensville, Wisconsin has discontinued its Original Pig Rassle tournament after 44 years of the tradition (above scenes from the event) Global Conservation Group, an animal advocacy group that launched an online petition claiming the tournament was inhumane to the pigs, garnered more than 80,000 signatures in efforts to cancel the event . On August 10, 2014, the church held a 'pig wrestling' event where the animals were 'punched in the face, kicked, body-slammed, yelled at and thrown onto a barrel', according to the Global Conversation Group. 'Wrestling, as a sport, is contested by two human opponents, evenly matched, each of whom enters into the match voluntarily with mutually agreed-upon rules and a common goal,' the group wrote on its website. 'Not so in ""matches"" like pig wrestling, where frightened animals are unwilling participants exploited by teams of humans for entertainment.' The group also accused the church of being in violation of Wisconsin Chapter 951, Crimes Against Animals, which outlaws cockfighting, dog fighting and any other similar fighting between animals or animals and humans, according to its Change.org page. The church announced  in a statement that moving forward the parish's talents could be 'spent in areas that are less controversial'. 'After much prayer and many hours of discussion, we realize that what we had for 44 years in the Original Pig Rassle was memorable, legal and great family fun,' the statement on its website read. The group said during the August 2014 'pig rassle', the pigs were 'punched in the face, kicked, body-slammed, yelled at and thrown onto a barrel' The Wisconsin parish (above) said during its 45th annual Roundup fundraiser this August, the Original Pig Rassle will be replaced with a human mud foosball tournament . Global Conservation Group said they consider the church's decision a victory for their 260-day campaign and consider this a huge step for animal welfare . 'We also realize that our parish and diocesan talents could be better spent in areas that are less controversial. 'It is with great regret that we have discontinued the Original Pig Rassle, we are however, very excited to begin this new tradition at St. Patrick Parish.' Following the news, Global Conservation Group, which protested the church's 'pig rassle' last August, wrote on its Change.org page on April 21: 'This is huge! After 260 days of non-stop campaigning, the church announced today that no further animal abuse events will be held.' 'We're very happy. We consider this a victory for our campaign,' Jordan Turner, Global Conservation Group President told WBAY. 'We're very proud of the church for doing what's right for all involved. And we certainly consider this a huge step for animal welfare.' Biglrien said the church is moving on as they look forward to the new event that will be apart of its annual Roundup this summer.

"Memphis Depay had a secret meeting with Manchester United on Wednesday as the club look to tie up a move for the PSV Eindhoven winger. Depay, 21, jetted to England with representatives including his agent Kees Ploegsma for a summit with a United delegation led by manager Louis van Gaal.

Manchester United are hoping to leave their rivals behind in the race to sign the young winger . PSV coach Phillip Cocu admitted: 'Van Gaal is a very good coach and the Premier League is great' Van gall refused to squash the reports in his weekly media briefing. When asked about the Depay link, Van Gaal said: 'I don’t discuss it with the media, you know my answer. 'I have a lot of relationships with players. I cannot buy all the players I've coached already.' Van Gaal, who worked with Depay at the World Cup, made inquiries over the player's availability last summer but decided to keep track of his progress rather than make a move. That could prove to be a costly decision, with the Dutch club looking for around £25m for his services after he scored 20 goals in 28 games. Depay, who has 'dream chaser' tattooed to his chest and is pictured here modelling a three-wheeled bike in October 2013, could line up at Old Trafford next season. PSV coach Phillip Cocu was unaware of the meeting when asked on Friday. He said: 'Van Gaal is a very good coach with whom I have worked and he was always very pleasant and the Premier League is a great league. 'I have contact with Memphis on a daily basis about many things, but not on a specific club or league.' United hold the upper hand in the hunt for Depay thanks to Van Gaal, who worked with the player during his stint in charge of Holland. PSV appear to be resigned to losing their star man this summer. Depay has become one of the hottest properties in European football after a blistering season . Louis van Gaal (right) was tempted to sign Depay last summer and will have to fork out around £25m . Depay, who often plays on the left wing despite being right-footed, has been compared with international team-mate Arjen Robben. However, Ed van Steijn, the man who scouted Cristiano Ronaldo for Manchester United, believes Depay is better than the Real Madrid star was at the same age. Speaking to Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, Van Steijn said: 'If I compare him to a young Cristiano Ronaldo at the time, then Depay has more strings to his bow. I like him better. 'Ronaldo did the same things wrong at Manchester United as he did when he was 17.'","Manchester United looking to tie up a deal for Memphis Depay .

"Floyd Mayweather Jnr's personal chef responsible for fuelling the the fighter ahead of his $300million clash with Manny Pacquiao has revealed her boss does have some weaknesses when it comes to food.

However, Mayweather's most unhealthy food craving has got to be 'fried hot dogs... with barbecue sauce'. Jeffries explains that she tries her best to ake them as healthy as possible: 'I cut them longways, and fry them up in a little coconut oil. I spice that up the barbeque sauce, too. 'I add a oranges, orange zest, and other spices. He loves barbecue sauce. Everything with barbecue sauce. But that's life. You like what you know.' As well as unusual eating requests, Jeffries also has to cope with Mayweather's unconventional timekeeping. The 38-year-old does not followed a structured training regime and prefers to decide when he does things according to how he is feeling, which can pose problems for his 24-hour chef who charges around £1,000 per meal. 'If Champ wants a meal at three, four, five, six in the morning, I have to be ready for that,' Jeffries said. 'He's called me at four and says, 'I want that oxtail.' Finding organic food stores in the early hours of the morning is also challenging, especially in Las Vegas. Mayweather and Pacquiao are just days away from their $300m mega-fight in Las Vegas . Jeffries explains how she is yet to find a farmers' market in the city and is restricted to a handful of 24-hour supermarkets, but not all departments stay open all night.

"The never-ending chaos at Leeds continued on Friday as six players withdrew from Saturday's game at Charlton citing injury. Italian quartet Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario del Fabro and Marco Silvestri, Frenchman Souleymane Doukara and Albanian Edgar Cani all told beleaguered head coach Neil Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London. Five of the sextet were signed by banned president Massimo Cellino, while Cani's deal was set-up by the Italian before he was banned by the Football League for failing its Owners and Directors Test. Mirco Antenucci is one of six Leeds players to have withdrawn from the squad to face Charlton with injury . It is understood that Redfearn was not aware of any problems with the players and that United's physio was not aware of any injuries. After receiving criticism from Leeds fans on Twitter after the story surfaced, Antenucci Tweeted: 'I'm reading a lot bad thing about myself in the last time.tomorrow i'll not be in the match because I got injured yesterday.it's the truth. 'I read so much wickedness and insults in many posts.i'm a serious professional but if someone likes to insult me there is no problem. my injury is in the right leg did yesterday in training .a muscle injury.' Goalkeeper Silvestri also Tweeted, posting a picture of a cut on his back which he suffered during Tuesday's loss at Norwich. He, Antenucci and Bellusci have been first-team regulars this season, with Cani, Del Fabro and Doukara resigned to roles on the fringes. It is understood that Neil Redfearn and the medical team were unaware of the players' injuries . Redfearn's position at Elland Road has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking off from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic. He saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime. Cellino is currently banned after being being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy. He has been banned from holding any influence over the club since the end of January and is set to return in a fortnight's time.

"All well and good having Brazilians in your team but they have to be the right ones – Barcelona reached the Champions League semi-finals at the Nou Camp at Paris Saint Germain’s expense and Neymar tied David Luiz in knots in the process. There were no Luis Suarez nutmegs this time but the former Chelsea defender found himself backpedaling hopelessly on the quarter hour as Neymar scooted past him for Barcelona’s opener. Neymar (top) celebrates with Brazilian compatriot Dani Alves after scoring his and Barcelona's second goal of the night . Neymar accelerates past another Brazil teammate, David Luiz, before opening the scoring for Barcelona on Tuesday night . Barcelona: Ter Stegen 6.5; Dani Alves 7.5, Pique 5, Mascherano 6, Jordi Alba 6; Rakitic 7.5, Busquets 7 (Sergi Roberto 55, 6), Iniesta 9 (Xavi 45, 6.5); Messi 6.5, Suarez 6.5 (Pedro 75, 6), Neymar 9. Subs not used: Bravo, Bartra, Adriano, Rafinha. Goals: Neymar 14, 34. PSG: Sirigu 6; Van der Wiel 3.5, Marquinhos 4.5, Luiz 5, Maxwell 6; Verratti 6, Cabaye 4 (Lucas Moura 66, 6.5), Matuidi 6 (Rabiot 80, 6); Cavani 4 (Lavezzi 80, 6.5), Ibrahimovic 4.5, Pastore 3. Subs not used: Douchez, Camara, Digne,  Bahebeck. Booked: Luiz. Referee: Svein Oddvar Moen (Norway) He was then a spectator on the half hour when his international team-mate got the second climbing unmarked to head Dani Alves’ cross past Salvatore Sirigu to make it 5-1 on aggregate. PSG’s soft centre cost them in the first leg and it was cruelly exposed again. Luiz was also booked inside the first five minutes for a foul on Andres Iniesta, who ran the first half. The man who won the World Cup for Spain but is these days criticised for neither scoring nor assisting went on a sublime run for the first goal, pulling away from Edinson Cavani and swerving past Marco Verratti before releasing Neymar. The French champions thought they were back in the game between the two Barcelona goals when on 17 minutes Zlatan Ibrahimovic had the ball in the net but he was a yard offside when Blaise Matuidi slipped him through and the flag was raised to rule out the goal. The Swede was jeered by Barcelona supporters in the early stages as was former Barcelona defender Maxwell but such was Barca’s dominance that home fans eased up on the light-hearted abuse. Suarez and Messi were also impressive in the first half and Alves looked like a man trying to impress a potential employer. PSG could still be a possible destination for him beyond the end of this season. He tested Sirigu from distance before his assist for Neymar’s second. With Suarez and Alves snapping into challenges and Iniesta and Neymar providing the finesse Barcelona were completely dominant – to the extent that for once Messi was not their most impressive performer. The home side eased up after the break and PSG breathed more easily without ever threatening to get back into the tie. Rakitic saw his shot saved and Messi went close with chip that Sirigu gathered.

Great Britain's tennis No 1 Andy Murray (left) was at the Nou Camp alongside his friend and former tennis player Ross Hutchins . PSG did force a save from Marc-Andre Ter Stegen 10 minutes into the second half when Ibrahimovic tried his luck from distance but the German keeper who has watched Claudio Bravo not put a foot wrong in the league all season gave another faultless display. Missing the domestic campaign has been tough but a final appearance in Berlin would be some consolation. Luis Enrique’s side were so comfortable at half-time Xavi replaced the impeccable Iniesta at the break. And it wasn’t long before Busquets and Suarez were also given early cuts. Barcelona still have a league to win and play the Catalan derby against Espanyol this weekend with sill just a narrow two point lead over Real Madrid. Iniesta had done enough in 45 minutes of football to not need to come out after half time. His performance and at times Barca’s was a throwback to some of their best football under Pep Guardiola when the won this completion in both 2009 and 2011. Iniesta was in sensational form for Barcelona before replaced at half time by veteran midfielder Xavi . Barcelona's captain had been criticised earlier this season for a lack of goals and assists but he looks to be back to his best . Guardiola was the name on most supporters lips at half time as news filtered through that Bayern were mauling Porto and were also heading for the semi-finals. The prospect of Barcelona and Bayern being drawn together on Thursday is mouth-watering. Although perhaps on current form, and in view of his side’s injuries, Guardiola might prefer to leave the reunions for Berlin on June 6.

"A New York City cop checking in on his elderly parents on Friday was horrified to discover them dead along with two other guests in their home. Robert Hugel, who is assigned to the Technical Assistance Response Unit, found the victims, all in their 70s and 80s, just after 3 p.m. at the house in Bellerose in Floral Park, Queens. The New York Post reports that Jerry Hugel, 83, his wife Marianne Hugel, 80, died along with 70-year-old neighbor Gloria Greco, and friend Walter Vondthadden, 76, in an apparent carbon monoxide poisoning, possibly caused by a car left running in a garage. Scroll down for video . Married 60 years: Neighbors say that Jerry and Marrianne Hugel were a happily married couple for 60 years who loved to dance, garden, and observe their German heritage . Cleaning up: Police Department personnel remove one of the bodies from a home where four people were found dead on Friday . It appeared the car was accidentally left running in the garage, but it was unclear for how long, investigators said. Neighbors lined the streets and sidewalks in the suburban neighborhood next to Long Island's Nassau County. Some cried as police officers and firefighters walked around the Cape Cod-style, two-story home. Before police officially identified the victims, neighbor Helga Harter told The Associated Press that the couple was named Jerry Hugel and Marie Hugel, who were in their 80s and had known her for 40 years. 'They were wonderful people,' Harter said through tears as she stood on a street corner, looking at the home. 'They were married for 60 years.' Heartbroken son: Robert Hugel was checking in on his elderly parents on Friday when he found them dead due to apparent carbon monoxide poisoning along with two of their friends . Medical aid: Emergency personnel gather near a home where police say four people were poisoned to death . The Hugels had five children, including son Robert Hugel, a New York Police Department officer who was said to have found his parents lifeless bodies. She described them as a 'great family' very active in the local German community. She last saw them on Wednesday at a Bavarian dancing class they attended together. 'I'm in shock,' Harter said. 'It's the greatest shock of my life.' The Hugels had lived in the home for 40 years, and an elderly woman lived upstairs as their tenant, Harter said. No visible trauma was observed on the victims' bodies, police said. Carbon monoxide, an odorless and colorless gas, is created when some fuels are burned. Hugel was found in the seat of his car in the garage and his wife was found in the room directly next to the garage, reports The New York Post. The scene:  Police stand outside the floral park home where four elderly people were found dead and where to windows are now wide open in an attempt to ventilate the apparent fume filled house . The couple’s friend, age 73, had been seated in the living room and the tenant, who sources said was older than 60, was found on the second floor at the top of the stairs. Neighbors were heartbroken after hearing about the deaths. 'It looks like it was accident, someone just forgot to turn the car off,' a source told The New York Daily News. 'The windows were air-tight, so there was nowhere for the gas to go.' 'It is very surreal,' said Barbara Stoja. 'We knew them for over 35 years. They were very fun people, they were dancers.' 'This is something you see on TV. It is so sad we all know each other to know he is not going to be there anymore.' Stoja said that Jerry Hugel was an avid gardener. 'He was just talking to my husband about planting tomatoes,' she said. Open windows: The four elderly people who died are thought to have been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning and police opened the windows of their home in an attempt to ventilate it . Stunned: Bystanders surround the Floral Park, Queens home where four elderly people died . 'He and my husband compare gardens all the time.' Neighbor Melissa O'Reilly said that the Hugels were avid dancers who loved their German heritage. 'They were such nice people, it’s really sad,' said Melissa O'Reilly, whose parents have lived on the block for three decades. 'They are a really nice family, everyone loves them, just good people, their kids are very nice.' O'Reilly said she knew the family for about 30 years. 'I grew up here, we always called them Mr. and Mrs. Hugel,' O’Reilly said. 'They have lived in that house before my parents moved here, and that was 30 years ago.' The deaths come on the heels of other deadly carbon monoxide incidents that killed at least 10 people on the Eastern Seaboard in recent weeks. A man and his seven children were found dead Monday in a home in Princess Anne, Maryland, where they apparently were poisoned in their sleep while running a generator after a utility cut power to their home on the state's Eastern Shore. The utility, Delmarva Power, said it cut off electricity for safety reasons on March 25, although relatives said the family was behind on its power bills. The family was last seen alive March 28. Saddened: Bystanders gather at the scene where four people were found dead on  Friday, April 10 . On Wednesday, a woman and her 7-year-old daughter were found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in their home in East Orange, New Jersey. Prosecutors said a utility company had shut off power at the home on Tuesday and a gas generator was being used there without proper ventilation. There was an inoperable carbon monoxide detector in that home, they said. City Councilman Mark Weprin, who represents the area including Floral Park, said he hoped the tragedy would shed light on the importance of having and maintaining carbon monoxide detectors in all homes and apartments. 'My thoughts and prayers go out to the friends and families of the victims,'  he said in an emailed statement.

"Ed Miliband today rushed to Scotland to try to shore up his hope of becoming Prime Minister as a damning poll showed almost half of Scots are ready to back the SNP. The Labour leader used a speech in Edinburgh to claim the Tory election campaign has descended into 'desperation and panic', as some polls put Labour ahead across the UK. But Mr Miliband has been rocked by a survey showing that in Scotland, 49 per cent of people plan to vote for the SNP, with just 25 per cent backing Labour, robbing him of any possibility of an overall majority. Scroll down for video . A poll of Scotlans shows 49 per cent of people plan to vote for the SNP, with just 25 per cent backing Labour . There has been a surge in support for the SNP in the months since the independence referendum in September . In September's referendum, 55 per cent voted in favour of staying in the UK, but the SNP has seen a surge in support since then and is set to take dozens of seats from Labour in the general election on May 7. The new YouGov poll for The Times shows Labour is down four points on last month to their lowest level since the survey began in 2007. The SNP is up three points to 49 per cent, a record high. Support for the Conservatives was up two points at 18 per cent and backing for the Liberal Democrats was up one point at 4 per cent. The results have delighted First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who insisted she is taking 'absolutely nothing for granted'. 'The polls are hugely encouraging and they show that that case that the SNP is putting forward for an end to austerity and support for the NHS and public services is winning support across Scotland.' Ms Sturgeon has offered to prop up a Labour government, even if the Tories win more seats on May 7. However, the SNP leader demanded full fiscal autonomy for Scotland in return, meaning all money raised in tax north of the border would be spent there. Labour leader Ed Miliband said the SNP's plan 'will mean a £7.6 billion hole in Scotland's finances' In a joint press conference, Mr Miliband was joined by his shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy . The SNP has proposed 'a modest increase in public spending' to end austerity and allow Scotland's health budget to rise by £2 billion by 2020. 'Let us lift austerity and have spending increases in the next parliament that are fiscally responsible but allow us to spend more money on our vital public services like the health service,' she said. 'I am proposing an increase in spending in the health service across the UK that would see by the end of this decade an additional £2 billion being spent on the NHS in Scotland. 'That's the choice we have at this election - continued austerity being proposed by the Tories and Labour, or an alternative to austerity, which is what the SNP is proposing, and we need a strong Scottish voice in Westminster that can force that alternative to austerity.' But in a joint press conference, Mr Miliband, his shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said the SNP's plan 'will mean a £7.6 billion hole in Scotland's finances'. Mr Miliband said: 'Today I challenge Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP to say how they will fill this GBP7.6 billion gap. Which services will be cut? Which taxes will be raised? And what cuts will it mean for pensioners in Scotland when they are taken out of the UK pensions system? 'The SNP claim in this campaign to be proposing no reductions in spending, but in fact they are planning dramatic reductions in spending. They must now come clean.' SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, pictured in Sterling today, has offered to prop up a Labour government, even if the Tories win more seats on May 7 . Ms Sturgeon joined with local candidate Steven Paterson while on the campaign trail in Stirling . The latest poll results have delighted First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who insisted she is taking 'absolutely nothing for granted' Mr Miliband pledged: 'I will never sell Scotland short by signing up to the SNP's plans. And I will never sell Britain short by abandoning the pooling and sharing of resources. Because this is a pooling and sharing which benefits all parts of our country, because we look after each other and we know we can only tackle the problems our country faces across the whole of the United Kingdom.' Speaking ahead of Mr Miliband's speech, Ms Sturgeon claimed that Labour was 'wrong' in its analysis. 'This is desperation on the part of the Labour Party,' the SNP leader said during a campaign visit to Stirling. 'Instead of putting forward a positive case of their own, they are resorting to the same fears and smears that they resorted to during the referendum. 'The truth is, the only cuts on the horizon for Scotland are the ones that the Tories are proposing and Labour are backing.'","YouGov poll of Scots: 49% backing SNP, 25% Labour,  18% Conservatives .

"A young waitress has claimed that England footballer Aaron Lennon grabbed her, slapped her and ripped her top as he partied in the VIP suite of a nightclub. The 18-year-old reportedly fled to the toilet in tears and afterwards told police that the £55,000-a-week Tottenham winger had left her with a bruise below her eye. The 28-year-old, who is on loan to Everton, was reportedly interviewed by officers under caution over the alleged assault earlier this month. A teenage waitress claims England footballer Aaron Lennon (pictured playing for Everton) grabbed her, slapped her and ripped her top . After taking part in Everton's 1-0 win at home against Southampton on April 4, Lennon is thought to have headed to Suede nightclub in Manchester with friends. Lennon, who has 21 England caps, lives in a penthouse apartment in the city centre. That night, the venue, which is popular with Premier League footballers, was packed with hundreds who had come to see singer Trey Songz perform. But later in the evening, the waitress claimed to have been attacked by the player in the VIP section - where booths cost £2,000. She was interviewed by Greater Manchester Police four days later. A source told The Sun's Michael Hamilton and Dean Wilkins that the girl, who is 'very pretty', had worked at the club for just under a year. He added that the footballer and his friends were 'spending a lot of money on drinks'.

"When Barcelona midfield maestro Xavi came on as a half-time substitute against PSG in the Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday night he sent records tumbling. The former Spain international played for 148th time in the competition, more than any other player since the tournament changed to its current format in 1992. Xavi also set the record for the most appearances in the knockout phase of the Champions League having now featured in 53 matches in the latter stages. Xavi made his 148th Champions League appearance against PSG on Tuesday night . Former Spain international Xavi shares a joke with his former team-mate Zlatan Ibrahimovic after the game . They are not records that the 35-year-old is likely to hold on his own for long, however. Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas is in line to equal Xavi's total in both Champions League games and knockout matches when Carlo Ancelotti's side take on Atletico in the second leg of their quarter-final on Wednesday night. While, Casillas' team-mate Cristiano Ronald will join Xavi on 53 knockout appearances if, as expected, he plays against Atletico. Former world champion Xavi also became the leading appearance-maker in all European competition with 170. Xavi celebrates with his team-mates after Barcelona won the Champions League in 2009 . Xavi (centre front) lines up for a Champions League clash against Manchester United in 1998 . Barcelona's safe passage to the semi-final was secured with a 2-0 win against the French champions as Neymar Jnr netted twice in the first half at the Nou Camp to give the Catalans a 5-1 aggregate win. Their progression gives Xavi the opportunity to play a further three times in the Champions League this season, should Barca reach the final. This is likely to be the midfielder's last season playing in the competition as he continues to be linked with a summer move to Qatari club Al Sadd, with reports in Spain suggesting he will sign a three-year deal. Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas can equal Xavi's Champions League appearances - all time and in the knockout phase - if he faces Atletico on Wednesday night . Cristiano Ronaldo will also draw level with Xavi for knockout stage appearances if he features on Wednesday . Casillas, meanwhile, has to help Real Madrid overcome their local rivals at the Bernabeu if he is to have any chance of adding to his appearances this season. Though the Spain goalkeeper is almost certain to pass his former international team-mate next season. Casillas has been linked with a move away from Real Madrid but joining a club playing in the Champions League would be a prerequisite for the experienced keeper.","Barcelona beat PSG 2-0 on Tuesday to reach Champions League semi-final .

"The first dramatic footage of the Hatton Garden jewellery heist shows how the gang returned twice in three days to continue their audacious robbery  - as it is revealed police may have to pay out millions in compensation for ignoring the alarm. The six-strong gang dressed in high-vis jackets were captured on CCTV working throughout Thursday night having successfully broken into the basement of the building in the heart of London’s jewellery district. Shockingly, the footage reveals they returned again on Saturday - spending another eight hours cleaning out the jewels and cash left there for safekeeping. Scroll down for video . The Mirror has obtained the first pictures of the six-strong gang which raided Hatton Gardens last week . Images obtained by the Daily Mirror reveal the precise timings of the raid for the first time - as well as the fact they used wheelie bins to remove millions of pounds worth of jewellery and valuables from the safe. Scotland Yard tonight refused to confirm to MailOnline whether they had seen the footage before it was handed to them by the Mirror, but it is likely to place even more pressure on police already under fire for not responding to the alarm. The footage begins at 9.23pm – just four minutes after staff at the safety deposit centre lock up for the Easter weekend – as the first thief appears on camera carrying a black bin bag. It was unclear exactly where the cameras were situated, but at least one is aimed outside the building and shows a white van thought to be the getaway vehicle. Over the following four nights, half a dozen raiders are seen lugging heavy-duty tools, including massive bolt cutters and a red monkey wrench down to the secure vault. Each member of the gang is wearing builder’s overalls and high-visibility vests. At least one has a balaclava over his face, while others wear dust masks – but each one is partially reconisable. The first raider to appear has been dubbed Mr Ginger after the colour of his hair. Another, wearing a builder’s hat, has been referred to as Mr Strong and is seen carrying steel supports that may have been used for the diamond-tipped drill that police say cut through into the vault. The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . The Tall Man – who wears an Adidas tracksuit – carries two red tools up and down the stairs. Another, dubbed the Old Man because of his grey hair, later appears to struggle for breath in the footage as he lugs bags from the vault. Two other raiders have been nicknamed The Gent, for his smart brown shoes, and Mr Montana because he is wears a sweatshirt emblazoned with the word. Reports say that he has a shaved head, and possibly an earring in his left ear. At about 9.40pm the gang disappear into the building. At 7.52am on Good Friday, according to the footage, members of the gang can be seen again. The street camera captures the white Transit pull up to the alley. On Sunday, at around 6am, the gem thieves can be seen dragging heavy wheelie bins and several black bags back up the stairs. It has been reported these contained potentially millions of pounds worth of jewellery and valuables. The last trace of the raiders is recorded at 6.44am on Easter Sunday, when a white van pulls up and the gang load it with all the remaining equipment and disappear. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the Flying Squad, speaks to journalists outside Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd today following last weekend's burglary in London . Another suspect, riding a moped, may also be connected to the gang. The raid was not discovered until the following Tuesday . The thieves apparently thought they had covered all their bases when covering their footsteps, but had failed to realise they had missed the cameras. A source told the Mirror: 'This was clearly the work of a professional gang who planned this job down to every last detail. 'But they may have made a mistake in leaving this footage behind.' The footage came to light as Scotland Yard was forced to admit it did not respond to a burglar alarm triggered during the raid - which could make it liable for million in compensation. That failure to investigate immediately left the gang free to work uninterrupted over Easter and escape with gems and cash worth ‘millions and millions’ from 70 deposit boxes - as can clearly be seen in the video. Officers were informed that the warning had been triggered shortly after midnight on Good Friday. But they decided that the possibility of a burglary did not need immediate investigation. Instead, a private security guard is understood to have made a cursory check of the building. Last night, jewellers who rent boxes with the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd security firm accused the police of incompetence and threatened to sue them and the owners of the deposit company. One jeweller, a 63-year-old named Michael, said: ‘As far as I’m concerned the police have got a lot to answer for. Suing anyone is a last resort but it’s something I would consider.’ A gang of criminals broke into the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend . Another jeweller called Ryan, who runs a business with his father in Hatton Garden, added: ‘It is just unbelievable that they could ignore a call from an alarm company.’ The deposit firm has also faced criticism over the building’s ‘antiquated’ alarm system. Security expert Seamus Fahy, 47, said: ‘It was a well-planned heist, but the lack of modern technology made it a lot less difficult than it should have been.’ A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required. We are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call. ‘It is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident.’","CCTV images reveal how the six-strong gang worked through the night .

"Thierry Henry has criticised Arsenal's recent dealings in the transfer window and has urged his former side to purchase four top players in the summer. The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title. Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker.

'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand . 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league. 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season, but everyone was saying they are not going win the league.'

"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has become the first governor in five years to visit Cuba, following President Obama's ease on trade and travel to  the communist nation. The Governor is heading a delegation of 18 academics and business leaders visiting the island in the wake of the December announcement that the US and Cuba would restore diplomatic relations after more than a half century of hostility and confrontation. Today, Cuomo met with Cuba's top officials for U.S. relations along with executives from Jetblue, MasterCard, Pfizer and other New York-based companies. Scroll down for video .

Business first: Cuomo has met with Cuba's top officials for U.S. relations along with executives from Jetblue, MasterCard, Pfizer and other New York-based companies . 'Like the people in Cuba, the people in New York and the United States are very excited about the courage that your president, Raul Castro, has shown, and the leadership that he has shown,' Cuomo said. 'We believe that this is going to be a dramatic change that is going to be to the benefit of the people of Cuba and also to the people of the United States.' Cuomo said the purpose of his visit was to see what can be . done now and look to the future should full trade be restored.

Malmierca. 'Our meeting with Minister Malmierca was very exciting and . informative,' Cuomo said. 'There is much hope for the future.' Obama loosened the trade embargo early this year with a series of executive actions that allow easier U.S. travel to Cuba, more remittances to the island and, at least on paper, U.S. exports to support the island's relatively new private business sector. Obama also moved to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terror, removing a barrier to access to the global financial system. Cuban officials have been pushing Obama to go further with measures that could include more specific federal licenses for U.S. businesses to trade with Cuba in ways currently prohibited. 'The president of the United States has the ability to grant licenses to businesses so that businesses can actually start developing right now in select areas and those are areas that we want to pursue,' Cuomo said. Ten previous U.S. governors have visited Cuba since 1999 but none since 2010, according to the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council.","Cuomo first US governor to visit Cuba since ease on trade and travel .

"The desperate parents of a boy whose head hangs at a 180-degree angle have admitted they would rather he died than continue to suffer. Mahendra Ahirwar, 12, from Madhya Pradesh in central India, suffers from a rare condition that makes his neck bend and his head hang from his body. His weak backbone means he can't stand or walk and is  restricted to a sitting position. Mahendra can just about crawl but needs help to eat and go to the toilet. Undiagnosed: Mahendra Ahirwar's parents say they would rather see him dead than suffer the way he is now . Mahendra's mother Sumitra Ahirwar, pictured here with her son, says watching his life is 'devastating' His father Mukesh Ahirwar, 40, and mother Sumitra Ahirwar, 35, who both work as labourers when they can, say they have consulted more than 50 doctors across India but none could diagnose his condition. ‘I cannot see him suffer anymore,' said Sumitra. 'Watching his life is devastating. 'He cannot do anything by himself. He just sits in a corner of the room all day. It's no life.' She added: 'I have to carry him like a baby everywhere but he is 12 years old, how will I carry him when he grows even older?' ‘If doctors cannot treat my son it is better that God takes him.’ Shockingly, members of the community have blamed Mahendra's condition on Mukesh's past sins and believe he is to blame for his son's disability. Sumitra, who also has healthy 16 and 10-year-old sons and a 14-year-old daughter, did not visit a doctor when she was pregnant with Mahendra. Family: Mahendra pictured with his mother Sumitra (left), sister Manisha (second from left), and brothers Surendra (second from right) and Lalit (right) Mukesh (pictured left carrying his son) has borrowed money from friends and relatives to help find medical treatment for Mahendra (left and right) Mukesh said: ‘Our other children had all been born normally with no problems so we never thought to consult a doctor or have an ultrasound done with Mahendra, and he was born at home just like his siblings.' The couple only noticed their son’s head was starting to hang when he was about six months old. 'At first we thought he was just a little weak and he'd be fine in time, but by his third birthday he wasn't able to keep his head upright at all,' his father explained. Mukesh, who earns about Rs200 (£2) a day on construction sites, has borrowed money from his friends and relatives to help find medical treatment for his son. But he said two years ago he decided to stop taking Mahendra to see any doctors, adding: 'I took him to all the hospitals that I could afford. 'Even India's premier hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences  in New Delhi, but after spending two weeks there doctors failed to tell us if my son could be treated. ‘With a broken heart we returned home and decided to raise him and try to give him as comfortable a life that we can.' Mahendra pictured with his father Mukesh (left),  mother Sumitra (seated) and brothers Lalit (centre) and Surendra (second from left) Sumitra has now lost all hope of a treatment being found for her son and says: 'If doctors cannot treat my son it is better that God takes him' Mukesh added: 'People say bad things about him, and they often laugh at him. It really hurts us. 'We cannot tolerate people's attitudes and discrimination. They say I must have committed some terrible sins and this is why he is suffering, it’s awful.' Mahendra doesn't go to school so his only friends are his siblings and his cousins. Dr Shashidhar Tatavarthy, an ear, nose and throat consultant at Delhi's Artemis Hospital, thinks Mahendra has a muscular disorder. He said: ‘This is one of the rarest of rare cases. His condition could be due to a spine anomaly or muscular disorder, but it can only be concluded after a thorough investigation.' Mukesh is still hoping for a miracle. 'If doctors can treat babies born with severe disabilities like two heads and give them lifesaving operations then why not my son?' he said. 'I still have so many hopes and dreams for him. I want to see him go to school and play with other kids. I want to see him living a normal life and I am hoping that my wish will be fulfilled one day.'","Mahendra Ahirwar, 12,  has a bent neck and his head hangs from his body .

Despite consulting over 50 doctors with no definitive diagnosis, the family has faced financial struggles while seeking treatment for Mahendra.

'The next six games could have a massive bearing on that. Ninety minutes is a big opportunity to change people's views. 'All individuals will be judged over that period. In football it does not matter if you have a contract or not, you always need to improve and show the right attitude and show you are ready to be part of the future of the club. 'But when you get players at the end of their contract there are decisions to be made and it is not just the club, it is the player as well.' Roberto Martinez says his club's recruitment team have been searching for targets for six months . Distin has played more for Everton's youth team than the first XI in the past month, and could be on his way . Martinez said they have established a list of transfer targets for the summer and, while he would not confirm publicly, Aston Villa's on-loan Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley, out of contract at the end of the season, is believed to be one of them. 'The recruitment department has been working really hard over the last six months and we need to assemble a really strong squad,' Martinez said. 'First and foremost it is an opportunity for young players to show they are ready for big important roles for next campaign and everyone else providing strong competition to be important figures for the future. Tom Cleverley, who is on loan at Aston Villa, is a target, with Martinez having worked with him before . 'The dressing room is very strong as it is now, so we need to make sure whatever we do in the summer is to get us in a better place. 'We know the situation with Tom. He is a player that I know well having worked with him (in a previous loan spell at Wigan) - and that's it. 'Tom is a player that is at the moment fighting for something very important for his club and that deserves respect. 'I wouldn't expect anyone to speak about my players and I would never do that.'","Antolin Alcaraz and Sylvain Distin are out of contract in the summer .
Neither player has been a first-team regular in recent weeks .
But manager Roberto Martinez insists both can force a new deal .
Everton have identified targets for the summer, including Tom Cleverley .","Roberto Martinez, Everton's manager, has not ruled out the possibility of offering new contracts to Antolin Alcaraz and Sylvain Distin, whose current deals expire this summer. While it's unlikely that Distin, aged 38 in December, will be retained, Alcaraz, 33 in July, may have a chance at a short-term extension. Martinez is also considering incorporating younger players like Tyias Browning and Brendan Galloway into the squad. The club's recruitment team has been searching for targets for the upcoming transfer window, with Tom Cleverley, currently on loan at Aston Villa, believed to be one of them. Martinez stresses the need to strengthen the squad and maintain strong competition for the future."
