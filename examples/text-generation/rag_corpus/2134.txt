Wilsonâs mother was probably a hypochondriac and Wilson seemed to think that he was often in poorer health than he really was.  However, he did suffer from hyper-tension at a relatively early age and may have suffered his first stroke at age 39.  He cycled regularly, including several cycling vacations in the Lake District in Britain.  Unable to cycle around Washington, D.C. as President, Wilson took to playing golf, although he played with more enthusiasm than skill.  During the winter the Secret Service would paint some golf balls black so Wilson could hit them around in the snow on the White House lawn.  for details on Wilson's health see Edwin A.
