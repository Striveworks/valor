Theodore Roosevelt promised to continue McKinley's program, and at first he worked closely with McKinley's men.  His 20,000-word address to the Congress in December 1901, asked Congress to curb the power of trusts "within reasonable limits." They did not act but Roosevelt did, issuing 44 lawsuits against major corporations; he was called the "trust-buster."
