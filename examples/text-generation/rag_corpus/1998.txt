On February 1, 1916, now settled in Grand Rapids, Dorothy King married Gerald Rudolff Ford, a salesman in a family-owned paint and varnish company, who later became president of the firm.     She began calling her son Gerald Rudolff Ford, Jr. The future president was never formally adopted, however, and he did not legally change his name until December 3, 1935; he also used a more conventional spelling of his middle name.     He was raised in Grand Rapids with his three half-brothers by his mother's second marriage: Thomas Gardner Ford (1918â1995), Richard Addison Ford (born 1924), and James Francis Ford (1927â2001). He also had three half-siblings by his father's second marriage: Marjorie King (1921â1993), Leslie Henry King, Sr. (1923â1976), and Patricia Jane King (born 1925).
