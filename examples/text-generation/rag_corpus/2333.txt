Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary depending on the location. Winters can be harsh in many regions of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near â15 Â°C (5 Â°F) but can drop below â40 Â°C (â40 Â°F) with severe wind chills.    In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground almost six months of the year, (more in the north).  Coastal British Columbia is an exception and enjoys a temperate climate with a mild and rainy winter.
