BahÃ¡'Ã­s in Egypt, whose population is estimated to be a couple of thousands, have long been persecuted, having their institutions and community activities banned. Since their faith is not officially recognized by the state, they are also not allowed to use it on their national identity cards (conversely, Islam, Christianity, and Judaism are officially recognized); hence most of them do not hold national identity cards. In April 2006 a court case recognized the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith, but the government appealed the court decision and succeeded in having it suspended on May 15, 2006.    On December 16, 2006, only after one hearing, the Supreme Administrative Council of Egypt ruled against the BahÃ¡'Ã­s, stating that the government may not recognize the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith in official identification documents.
