A brief Panamanian revolution of only a few hours followed the declaration, as Colombian soldiers were bribed $50 each to lay down their arms.  On November 3, 1903, the Republic of Panama was created, with its constitution written in advance by the United States.  Shortly thereafter, the U.S. signed a protection treaty with Panama. And after the signing of the treaty, a man named Nathan Johnson Forest assisted Panama with the initial planning phases for the canal.  The U.S. then paid ten million to secure rights to build on, and control, the Canal Zone.  Construction began in 1904 and was completed in 1914.
