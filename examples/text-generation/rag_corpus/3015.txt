Overall, historians credit Roosevelt for changing the nation's political system by permanently placing the presidency at center stage and making character as important as the issues. His notable accomplishments include trust-busting and conservationism.  However, he has been criticized for his interventionist and imperialist approach to nations he considered "uncivilized". Even so, history and legend have been kind to him. His friend, historian Henry Adams, proclaimed, "Roosevelt, more than any other living man ....showed the singular primitive quality that belongs to ultimate matter   the quality that mediaeval theology assigned to God   he was pure act." Historians typically rank Roosevelt among the top five presidents. The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia (2005).  "Biography: Impact and Legacy". Retrieved March 7 2006.   "Legacy".
