In Norse mythology, Fenrir or Fenrisulfr is a gigantic wolf, the son of Loki and the giantess AngrboÃ°a. Fenrir is bound by the gods, but is ultimately destined to grow too large for his bonds and devour Odin during the course of RagnarÃ¶k. At that time he will have grown so large that his upper jaw touches the sky while his lower touches the earth when he gapes. He will be slain by Odin's son, ViÃ°arr, who will either stab him in the heart or rip his jaws asunder according to different accounts. Stories of werewolves can be found in virtually all European countries; these date back from Ancient Greek legend of Lycaon, who in one story was transformed into a wolf as a result of eating human flesh, and the writings of the Roman scholar, Pliny the Elder.   22/34
