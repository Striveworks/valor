During the debates of 1858, the issue of race was often discussed. During a time period when few believed in racial egalitarianism, Stephen Douglas informed the crowds, "If you desire Negro citizenshipâ¦ if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselvesâ¦ then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro."  First Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858  Lincoln countered that he was "not in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races."  Fourth Debate with Stephen A. Douglas at Charleston, Illinois, September 18, 1858  His opposition to slavery was opposition to the Slave Power, though this would change during the course of the Civil War. Donald, (1995) ch. 8.
