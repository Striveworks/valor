Polar bears, being both curious and scavengers   will, where they come into contact with humans, investigate and consume garbage.  This has been documented at the dump in Churchill, Manitoba prior to its closure.  .  Polar bears may attempt to consume almost anything they can find, including hazardous substances such as styrofoam, plastic, car batteries, ethylene glycol, hydraulic fluid, and motor oil.  .   .  To protect the bears, the Churchill dump was closed in 2006. Garbage is now recycled or transported to Thompson, Manitoba.  Hudson Bay Post
