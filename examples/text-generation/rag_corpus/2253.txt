In 1775, Volta improved and popularized the electrophorus, a device that produces a static electric charge.  His promotion of it was so extensive that he is often credited with its invention, although it had actually  been invented in 1764 by Swedish professor Johan Carl Wilcke  , p.73     In 1776-77 he studied the chemistry of gases, discovered methane, and devised experiments such as the ignition of gases by an electric spark in a closed vessel. Volta also studied what we now call capacitance, developing separate means to study both electrical potential V and charge Q, and discovering that for a given object they are proportional.  This may be called Volta's Law of Capacitance, and likely for this work the unit of electrical potential has been named the volt.
