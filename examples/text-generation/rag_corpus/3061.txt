Because the province was rich in ores, and especially silver and gold ,    the Romans heavily colonized the province,     brought with them Vulgar Latin and started a period of intense romanization (giving birth to proto-Romanian).          But in the 3rd century AD, with the invasions of migratory populations such as Goths, the Roman Empire was forced to pull out of Dacia in 270 AD, thus making it the first province to be abandoned.
