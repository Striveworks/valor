Sir Isaac Newton FRS ( ) (4 January 1643 â March 31 1727)   [  OS: December 25 1642 â March 20 1727 ]    was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, and alchemist. His treatise PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion, laying the groundwork for classical mechanics, which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries and is the basis for modern engineering.  He showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws by demonstrating the consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravitation, thus removing the last doubts about heliocentrism and advancing the scientific revolution.
