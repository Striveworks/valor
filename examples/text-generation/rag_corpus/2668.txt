In 1779  he published an important investigation of the laws of friction, ThÃ©orie des machines simples, en ayant Ã©gard au frottement de leurs parties et Ã  la roideur des cordages (Theory of simple machines with regard for the friction of their parts and the tension of the ropes), which was followed twenty years later by a memoir on viscosity.
