In literature, Pascal is regarded as one of the most important authors of the French Classical Period and is read today as one of the greatest masters of French prose. His use of satire and wit influenced later polemicists. The content of his literary work is best remembered for its strong opposition to the rationalism of RenÃ© Descartes and simultaneous assertion that the main countervailing philosophy, empiricism, was also insufficient for determining major truths.
