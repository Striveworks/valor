The World Economic Forum has declared Finland to be the most competitive country in the world for three consecutive years (2003â2005) and four times since 2002.    In recent years there has been national focus on innovation and research and development, with special emphasis on information technology.    Nokia, the telecommunications company, is generally regarded as the single most significant cause of Finland's success.
