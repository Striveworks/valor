Studies of leopard home range size have tended to focus on protected areas, which may have led to skewed data; as of the mid-1980s, only 13% of the leopard range actually fell within a protected area.    In their IUCN survey of the literature, Nowell and Jackson suggest male home territories vary between 30-78 square kilometers, but just 15-16 kmÂ² for females.  Research in a conservation area in Kenya shows similar territory sizes and sex differential: 32.8 kmÂ² ranges for males, on average, and 14 kmÂ² for females.    In Nepal, somewhat larger male ranges have been found at about 48 kmÂ², while female ranges are in-keeping with other research, at 17 kmÂ²; female home territories were seen to decrease to just five to seven kmÂ² when young cubs were present, while the sexual difference in range size seemed to be in positive proportion to overall increase.     However, significant variations in size of home territories have been suggested across the leopard's range. In Namibia, for instance, research that focussed on spatial ecology in farmlands outside of protected areas found ranges that were consistently above 100 kmÂ², with some more than 300 kmÂ²; admitting that their data were at odds with others', the researchers also suggested little or no sexual variation in the size of territories.  Virtually all sources suggest that males do have larger ranges. There seems to be little or no overlap in territory amongst males, although overlap exists between the sexes; one radio-collar analysis in the Ivory Coast found a female home range completely enclosed within a male's.
