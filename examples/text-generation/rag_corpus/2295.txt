Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes during the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s. QuÃ©bÃ©cois nationalists began pressing for greater provincial autonomy. The separatist Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois first came to power in 1976. A referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980 was rejected by a solid majority of the population, and a second referendum in 1995 was rejected by a slimmer margin of just 50.6% to 49.4%.    In 1997, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession by a province to be unconstitutional; Quebec's sovereignty movement has continued nonetheless.
