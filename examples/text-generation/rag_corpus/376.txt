There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincolnâs moral and intellectual development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincolnâs personal philosophy was shaped by "an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning." It was Lincolnâs reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs. Guelzo pg. 20. Miller pg. 57-59  Lincolnâs reading and study of the Bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots.
