After the negotiated retreat of Soviet troops in 1958, Romania, under the new leadership of Nicolae CeauÅescu, started to pursue independent policies. Such examples are the condemnation of the Soviet-led 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia (being the only Warsaw Pact country not to take part in the invasion), the continuation of diplomatic relations with Israel after the Six-Day War of 1967 (again, the only Warsaw Pact country to do so), the establishment of economic (1963) and diplomatic (1967) relations with the Federal Republic of Germany, and so forth.

"countrystudies.us: Middle East policies in Communist Romania"  A short-lived period of relative economic well-being and openness followed in the late 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s.  As Romania's foreign debt sharply increased between 1977 and 1981 (from 3 to 10 billion US dollars),    the influence of international financial organisations such as the IMF or the World Bank grew, conflicting with Nicolae CeauÅescu's autarchic policies.  CeauÅescu eventually initiated a project of total reimbursement of the foreign debt (completed in 1989, shortly before his overthrow).  To achieve this goal, he imposed policies that impoverished Romanians and exhausted the Romanian economy.  He greatly extended the authority police state  and imposed a cult of personality . These lead to a dramatic decrease in CeauÅescu-popularity  and culminated in his overthrow and death in the bloody Romanian Revolution of 1989.
