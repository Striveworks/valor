Roosevelt's lasting popular legacy, however, is the stuffed toy bearsâteddy bearsânamed after him following an incident on a hunting trip in 1902. Roosevelt famously refused to kill a captured black bear simply for the sake of making a kill. Bears and later bear cubs became closely associated with Roosevelt in political cartoons thereafter.
