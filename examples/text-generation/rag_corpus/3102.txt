According to the 2002 census, Romania has a population of 21,698,181 and, similarly to other countries in the region, is expected to gently decline in the coming years as a result of sub-replacement fertility rates. Romanians make up 89.5% of the population. The largest ethnic minorities are Hungarians, who make up 6.6% of the population and Roma, or Gypsies, who make up 2% of the population. By the official census 535,250 Roma live in Romania. 2002 census data, based on  Population by ethnicity, gives a total of 535,250 Roma in Romania. This figure is disputed by other sources, because at the local level, many Roma declare a different ethnicity (mostly Romanian, but also Hungarian in the West and Turkish in Dobruja) for fear of discrimination. Many are not recorded at all, since they   do not have ID cards. International sources give higher figures than the official census( UNDP's Regional Bureau for Europe,  World Bank,  International Association for Official Statistics).   usatoday: European effort spotlights plight of the Roma  Hungarians, who are a sizeable minority in Transylvania, constitute a majority in the counties of Harghita and Covasna.
