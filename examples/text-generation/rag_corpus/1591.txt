A quarter of Finland's territory lies above the Arctic Circle, and as a consequence the midnight sun can be experienced â for more days, the farther north one travels. At Finland's northernmost point, the sun does not set for 73 consecutive days during summer, and does not rise at all for 51 days during winter.
