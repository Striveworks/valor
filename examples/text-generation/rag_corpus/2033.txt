Ford's description matched a  drawing prepared for the Commission under the direction of Dr. James J. Humes, supervisor of Kennedy's autopsy, who in his  testimony to the Commission said three times that the entrance wound was in the "low neck." The Commission was not shown the autopsy photographs.  The Commission's work continues to be debated in the public arena.
