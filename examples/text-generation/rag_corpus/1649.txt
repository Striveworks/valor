Until the 1960s, Finnish energy policy relied on the electricity produced by hydropower stations and extensive decentralised use of wood for energy. Finland's 187,888 lakes do not lie much above sea level â less than 80 metres in the case of the two biggest lakes, Saimaa and PÃ¤ijÃ¤nne. Consequently, Finland has less hydropower capacity than Sweden or Norway.
