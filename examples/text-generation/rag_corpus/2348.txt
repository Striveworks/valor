Canadian provinces and territories are responsible for education. Each system is similar while reflecting regional history, culture and geography.    The mandatory school age ranges between  5â7 to 16â18 years,  contributing to an adult literacy rate that is 99%.  Postsecondary education is also administered by provincial and territorial governments, who provide most of the funding; the federal government administers additional research grants, student loans and scholarships. In 2002, 43% of Canadians aged between 25 and 64 had post-secondary education; for those aged 25 to 34 the post-secondary attainment reaches 51%.
