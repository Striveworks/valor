The word duck (from Anglo-Saxon dÅ«ce), meaning the bird, came from the verb "to duck" (from Anglo-Saxon supposed *dÅ«can) meaning "to bend down low as if to get under something" or "to dive", because of the way many species in the dabbling duck group feed by upending (compare Dutch duiken, German tauchen = "to dive").
