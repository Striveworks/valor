Although Faraday received little formal education and knew little of higher mathematics, such as calculus, he was one of the most influential scientists in history. Some historians    of science refer to him as the best experimentalist in the history of science.  "best experimentalist in the history of science." Quoting Dr Peter Ford, from the University of Bathâs Department of Physics. Accessed January 2007.  The SI unit of capacitance, the farad, is named after him, as is the Faraday constant, the charge on a mole of electrons (about 96,485 coulombs).  Faraday's law of induction states that a magnetic field changing in time creates a proportional electromotive force.
