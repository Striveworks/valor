Relative to its population, Finland has been the number one country in the world in automobile racing, measured by international success. Finland has produced three Formula One World Champions â Keke Rosberg (Williams, 1982), Mika HÃ¤kkinen (McLaren, 1998 and 1999) and Kimi RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen (Ferrari, 2007). Along with RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen, the other Finnish Formula One driver currently active is Heikki Kovalainen (McLaren). Rosberg's son, Nico Rosberg (Williams), is also currently driving, but under his mother's German nationality. Other notable Finnish Grand Prix drivers include Leo Kinnunen, JJ Lehto and Mika Salo. Finland has also produced most of the world's best rally drivers, including the ex-WRC World Champion drivers Marcus GrÃ¶nholm, Juha Kankkunen, Hannu Mikkola, Tommi MÃ¤kinen, Timo Salonen and Ari Vatanen. The only Finn to have won a road racing World Championship, Jarno Saarinen, was killed in 1973 while racing.
