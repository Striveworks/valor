By the time Wilson finished Congressional Government, Grover Cleveland was President, and Wilson had his faith in the United States government restored.  When William Jennings Bryan captured the Democratic nomination from Cleveland's supporters in 1896, however, Wilson refused to stand by the ticket.  Instead, he cast his ballot for John M. Palmer, the presidential candidate of the National Democratic Party, or Gold Democrats, a short-lived party that supported a gold standard, low tariffs, and limited government.  David T.
