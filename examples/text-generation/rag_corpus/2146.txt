Wilson served on the faculties of Bryn Mawr College and Wesleyan University (where he also coached the football team) and founded the Wesleyan University debate team (which to this date is named the T. Woodrow Wilson debate team) before joining the Princeton faculty as professor of jurisprudence and political economy in 1890. While there, he was one of the faculty members of the short-lived coordinate college, Evelyn College for Women.  Additionally, Wilson became the first lecturer of Constitutional Law at New York Law School where he taught with Charles Evans Hughes.
