Romania is divided into forty-one counties (judeÅ£e), as well as the municipality of Bucharest (BucureÅti) - which is its own administrative unit. Each county is administered by a county council (consiliu judeÅ£ean), responsible for local affairs, as well as a prefect, who is appointed by the central government but cannot be a member of any political party.
