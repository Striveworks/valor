After Russia left the war in 1917 following the Bolshevik Revolution the Allies sent troops, presumably, to prevent a German or Bolshevik takeover of allied-provided weapons, munitions and other supplies which had been previously shipped as aid to the Czarist government. Wilson sent armed forces to assist the withdrawal of Czech and Slovak prisoners along the Trans-Siberian Railway, hold key port cities at Arkangel and Vladivostok, and safeguard supplies sent to the Tsarist forces.  Though not sent to engage the Bolsheviks, the U.S. forces had several armed conflicts against Russian forces.  Wilson withdrew the soldiers on April 1, 1920, though some remained as late as 1922.  As Davis and Trani conclude, "Wilson, Lansing, and Colby helped lay the foundations for the later Cold War and policy  of containment. There was no military confrontation,  armed standoff, or arms race. Yet, certain basics were there:  suspicion, mutual misunderstandings, dislike, fear,  ideological hostility, and diplomatic isolation....Each side was driven by  ideology, by capitalism versus communism. Each country sought  to reconstruct the world. When the world resisted,  pressure could be used."  Donald E. Davis and Eugene P.
