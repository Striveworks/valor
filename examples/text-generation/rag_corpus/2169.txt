Wilson narrowly won the election, defeating Republican candidate Charles Evans Hughes.  As governor of New York from 1907-1910, Hughes had a progressive record strikingly similar to Wilson's as governor of New Jersey. Theodore Roosevelt would comment that the only thing different between Hughes and Wilson was a shave. However, Hughes had to try to hold together a coalition of conservative Taft supporters and progressive Roosevelt partisans and so his campaign never seemed to take a definite form.  Wilson ran on his record and ignored Hughes, reserving his attacks for Roosevelt.  When asked why he did not attack Hughes directly, Wilson told a friend to âNever murder a man who is committing suicide.â
