Canada automatically entered the First World War in 1914 with Britain's declaration of war, sending volunteers to the Western Front. The Conscription Crisis of 1917  erupted when conservative Prime Minister Robert Borden brought in compulsory military service over the objection of French-speaking Quebecers.  In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain; in 1931 the Statute of Westminster affirmed Canada's independence.
