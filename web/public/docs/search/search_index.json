At a high-level, the typical workflow involves posting groundtruth annotations (class labels, bounding boxes, segmentation masks, etc.) and model predictions to the service. Velour, on the backend, then handles the computation of metrics, stores them centrally, and allows them to be queried. Velour does not store raw data (such as underlying images) or facilitate model inference. It only stores groundtruth annotations and the predictions outputted from a model.</p> <p>Some highlights:</p> <ul> <li>The service handles the computation of metrics. This help makes them trustworthy and auditable, and is also useful when metric computations can be computationally expensive (e.g. for object detection).</li> <li>Metrics are centralized and queryable. In particular, the service facilicates comparing performance of multiple models against multiple datasets.</li> <li>Since inferences and groundtruths are stored, additional metrics can be computed without having to redo model inferences. For example, maybe you run default AP metric settings for object detection but later decide you want to know AP at lower IOU thresholds.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"client/","title":"Working with the Python client","text":"<p>Here we cover the basic concepts involved in interacting with the <code>velour</code> service via the Python client.</p> <p>Additionally, sample Jupyter notebooks are available here.</p>"},{"location":"client/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>The client is hosted on PyPI and can be installed via</p> <pre><code>pip install velour-client\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"client/#supported-tasks","title":"Supported tasks","text":"<p>Currently <code>velour</code> supports the following groundtruth label types:</p> <ul> <li>image classifications</li> <li>object detections</li> <li>instance segmentations</li> <li>semantic segmentations</li> <li>tabular data classifications</li> </ul> <p>Each case has the notion of a label, which is a key/value pair.
